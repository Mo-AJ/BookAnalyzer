Abbreviations\n\nThere have been some significant changes in this edition. In the\nGovernment section the former Branches entry has been replaced by\nthree entries--Executive branch, Legislative branch, and Judicial\nbranch. The Leaders entry now has subentries for Chief of State,\nHead of Government, and their deputies. The Elections entry has\nbeen completely redone with information for each branch of the\nnational government, including the date for the last election, the\ndate for the next election, results (percent of vote by candidate or\nparty), and current distribution of seats by party. In the Economy\nsection there is a new entry on Illicit drugs.\n\nAbbreviations: (see Appendix B for international organizations)\n\n          avdp.     avoirdupois\n          c.i.f.    cost, insurance, and freight\n          CY        calendar year\n          DWT       deadweight ton\n          est.      estimate\n          Ex-Im     Export-Import Bank of the United States\n          f.o.b.    free on board\n          FRG       Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany)\n          FY        fiscal year\n          GDP       gross domestic product\n          GDR       German Democratic Republic (East Germany)\n          GNP       gross national product\n          GRT       gross register ton\n          km        kilometer\n          km2       square kilometer\n          kW        kilowatt\n          kWh       kilowatt-hour\n          m         meter\n          NA        not available\n          NEGL      negligible\n          nm        nautical mile\n          NZ        New Zealand\n          ODA       official development assistance\n          OOF       other official flows\n          PDRY      People's Democratic Republic of Yemen {Yemen\n                    (Aden) or South Yemen}\n          UAE       United Arab Emirates\n          UK        United Kingdom\n          US        United States\n          USSR      Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Soviet Union)\n          YAR       Yemen Arab Republic {Yemen (Sanaa) or North Yemen}\n\nAdministrative divisions: The numbers, designatory terms, and\nfirst-order administrative divisions are generally those approved by the\nUnited States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) as of 5 April 1990. Changes\nthat have been reported but not yet acted upon by BGN are noted.\n\nArea: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited\nby international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the\naggregate of all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or\ncoastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).\nComparative areas are based on total area equivalents. Most entities\nare compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states. The smaller\nentities are compared with Washington, DC (178 km2, 69 miles2) or\nThe Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 km2, 0.23 miles2, 146 acres).\n\nBirth rate: The average annual number of births during a year\nper 1,000 population at midyear. Also known as crude birth rate.\n\nContributors: Information was provided by the Bureau of the\nCensus (Department of Commerce), Central Intelligence Agency,\nDefense Intelligence Agency, Defense Nuclear Agency, Department of\nState, Foreign Broadcast Information Service, Navy Operational\nIntelligence Center and Maritime Administration (merchant marine data),\nOffice of Territorial and International Affairs (Department of the\nInterior), United States Board on Geographic Names, United States\nCoast Guard, and others.\n\nDates of information: In general, information available as of 1\nJanuary 1990 was used in the preparation of this edition. Population\nfigures are estimates for 1 July 1990, with population growth rates\nestimated for mid-1990 through mid-1991. Major political events have\nbeen updated through 30 March 1990. Military age figures are average\nannual estimates for 1990-94.\n\nDeath rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year\nper l,000 population at midyear. Also known as crude death rate.\n\nDiplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic\nrelations with 162 nations. There are only 144 US embassies, since some\nnations have US ambassadors accredited to them, but no physical US\nmission exists. The US has diplomatic relations with 149 of the 159 UN\nmembers--the exceptions are Albania, Angola, Byelorussia (constituent\nrepublic of the Soviet Union), Cambodia, Cuba, Iran, Vietnam, People's\nDemocratic Republic of Yemen {Yemen (Aden) or South Yemen}, Ukraine\n(constituent republic of the Soviet Union) and, obviously, the US itself.\nIn addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 13 nations that are not\nin the UN--Andorra, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati,\nLiechtenstein, Marshall Islands, Monaco, Nauru, San Marino, South Korea,\nSwitzerland, Tonga, Tuvalu, and the Vatican City. North Korea is not in\nthe UN and the US does not have diplomatic relations with that nation.\nThe US has not recognized the incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, and\nLithuania into the Soviet Union and continues to accredit the diplomatic\nrepresentatives of their last free governments.\n\nDisputes: This category includes a wide variety of situations\nthat range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral\nclaims of one sort or another. Every international land boundary\ndispute in the \"Guide to International Boundaries,\" a map published\nby the Department of State, is included. References to other situations\nmay also be included that are border- or frontier-relevant, such as\nmaritime disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues.\nHowever, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance\nor recognition by the US Government.\n\nEntities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special\nsovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not\nindependent, and others are not officially recognized by the US\nGovernment. Nation refers to a people politically organized into a\nsovereign state with a definite territory. Dependent area refers to a\nbroad category of political entities that are associated in some way\nwith a nation. Names used for page headings are usually the short-form\nnames as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. The\nlong-form name is included in the Government section and an entry\nof \"none\" indicates a long-form name does not exist. In some\ninstances, no short-form name exists--then the long-form name must\nserve for all usages.\n\nThere are 249 entities in the Factbook that may be categorized as\nfollows:\n\nNATIONS\n157 UN members (there are 159 members in the UN, but only 157 are\n      included in The World Factbook because Byelorussia and Ukraine are\n      constituent republics of the Soviet Union)\n 15 nations that are not members of the UN--Andorra, Federated States of\n      Micronesia, Kiribati, Liechtenstein, Marshall Islands, Monaco,\n      Namibia, Nauru, North Korea, San Marino, South Korea, Switzerland,\n      Tonga, Tuvalu, Vatican City\n\nOTHER\n  1 Taiwan\n\nDEPENDENT AREAS\n  6 Australia--Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island,\n      Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and\n      McDonald Islands, Norfolk Island\n  2 Denmark--Faroe Islands, Greenland\n 16 France--Bassas da India, Clipperton Island, Europa Island,\n      French Guiana, French Polynesia, French Southern and Antarctic\n      Lands, Glorioso Islands, Guadeloupe, Juan de Nova Island,\n      Martinique, Mayotte, New Caledonia, Reunion, St. Pierre and\n      Miquelon, Tromelin Island, Wallis and Futuna\n  2 Netherlands--Aruba, Netherlands Antilles\n  3 New Zealand--Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau\n  3 Norway--Bouvet Island, Jan Mayen, Svalbard\n  1 Portugal--Macau\n 16 United Kingdom--Anguilla, Bermuda, British Indian Ocean Territory,\n      British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands,\n      Gibraltar, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Isle of Man, Jersey, Montserrat,\n      Pitcairn Islands, St. Helena, South Georgia and the South Sandwich\n      Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands\n 15 United States--American Samoa, Baker Island, Guam, Howland Island,\n      Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Islands,\n      Navassa Island, Northern Mariana Islands, Palmyra Atoll,\n      Puerto Rico, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (Palau),\n      Virgin Islands, Wake Island\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n  7 Antarctica, Gaza Strip, Iraq-Saudi Arabia Neutral Zone,\n      Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, West Bank, Western Sahara\n\nOTHER ENTITIES\n  4 oceans--Arctic Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean\n  1 World\n===\n249 total\n\nNotes: The US Government has not recognized the incorporation of\nEstonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the Soviet Union as constituent\nrepublics during World War II. Those Baltic states are not members of the\nUN and are not included in the list of nations. The US Government does\nnot recognize the four so-called \"independent\" homelands of\nBophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei, and Venda in South Africa.\n\nGross domestic product (GDP): The value of all goods and\nservices produced domestically.\n\nGross national product (GNP): The value of all goods and\nservices produced domestically, plus income earned abroad, minus\nincome earned by foreigners from domestic production.\n\nGNP/GDP methodology: GNP/GDP dollar estimates for the OECD\ncountries, the USSR, Eastern Europe, and a portion of the developing\ncountries, are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP)\ncalculations rather than from conversions at official currency exchange\nrates. The PPP methods involve the use of average price weights,\nwhich lie between the weights of the domestic and foreign price systems;\nusing these weights, US $100 converted into German marks by a PPP\nmethod will buy an equal amount of goods and services in both the US\nand Germany. One caution: the proportion of, say, military expenditures\nas a percent of GNP/GDP in local currency accounts may differ\nsubstantially from the proportion when GNP/GDP is expressed in PPP dollar\nterms, as, for example, when an observer estimates the dollar level of\nSoviet or Japanese military expenditures. Similarly, dollar figures for\nexports and imports reflect the price patterns of international\nmarkets rather than PPP price patterns.\n\nGrowth rate (population): The annual percent change in the\npopulation, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over\ndeaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country.\nThe rate may be positive or negative.\n\nIllicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit\ndrugs--narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens,\nand cannabis. These categories include many drugs legally produced and\nprescribed by doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold\noutside medical channels.\n\n  Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, provides\nhallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot,\nAcapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol),\nhashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).\n\n  Coca (Erythroxylon coca) is a bush and the leaves contain the stimulant\ncocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa which comes from cacao\nseeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.\n\n  Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.\n\n  Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and\ninclude chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,\nphenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone\n(Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,\nValmid).\n\n  Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,\nemotional, or behavioral change in an individual.\n\n  Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that\nresults in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an\nindividual.\n\n  Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,\nself-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot),\nmescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA,\nSTP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues\n(PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin, psilocyn).\n\n  Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant\n(Cannabis sativa).\n\n  Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.\n\n  Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant\n(Cannabis sativa).\n\n  Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to\nopium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics\ninclude opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol),\ncodeine (Tylenol w/codeine, Empirin w/codeine, Robitussan A-C), and\nthebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and\nhydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics include meperidine or\nPethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and\nothers (Darvon, Lomotil).\n\n  Opium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the\nopium poppy.\n\n  Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural and\nsemisynthetic narcotics.\n\n  Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried\nopium poppy.\n\n  Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis\nthat is chewed or drunk as tea.\n\n  Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and\nactivity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn,\nDexedrine), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and\nothers (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).\n\nInfant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one\nyear of age in a given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same\nyear.\n\nLand use: Human use of the land surface is categorized as\narable land--land cultivated for crops that are replanted after\neach harvest (wheat, maize, rice); permanent crops--land\ncultivated for crops that are not replanted after each harvest\n(citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and pastures--land permanently\nused for herbaceous forage crops; forest and woodland--land under\ndense or open stands of trees; and other--any land type not\nspecifically mentioned above (urban areas, roads, desert). The\npercentage figure for irrigated refers to the portion of the entire\namount of land area that is artificially supplied with water.\n\nLeaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country\nwho represents the state at official and ceremonial funcions but is not\ninvolved with the day-to-day activities of the government. The head\nof government is the administrative leader who manages the day-to-day\nactivities of the government. In the UK, the monarch is the chief\nof state and the prime minister is the head of government. In the US,\nthe President is both the chief of state and the head of government.\n\nLife expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived\nby a group of people all born in the same year, if mortality at each\nage remains constant in the future.\n\nMaritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent\nsome national claims from being fully extended.\n\nMerchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All\ncommercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which\nexcludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc. Also, a\ngrouping of merchant ships by nationality or register.\n\n     Captive register--A register of ships maintained by a territory,\npossession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships\nowned in the parent country. Also referred to as an offshore register,\nthe offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a captive\nregister will fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local\nvariant of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation\nrules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a captive\nregister makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent\ncountry, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned\nabroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience\nregister, except that it is not the register of an independent state.\n\n     Flag of convenience register--A national register offering\nregistration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major\nflags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their register by virtue\nof low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal\nmanning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having\nrelatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag\nstate. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a\ngiven set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority\nof the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an\nopen register.\n\n     Flag state--The nation in which a ship is registered and which\nholds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home\nor abroad. Differences in flag state maritime legislation determine\nhow a ship is manned and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be\nplaced on the register.\n\n      Internal register--A register of ships maintained as a subset of\na national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national\nflag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of\nmaritime rules from those on the main national register. These\ndifferences usually include lower taxation of profits, manning by\nforeign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the flag state\n(when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International\nShip Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most\nnotable examples of an internal register. Both have been instrumental\nin stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and in\nattracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags.\n\n     Merchant ship--A vessel that carries goods against payment of\nfreight. Commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately\nrestricted to commercial vessels only.\n\n     Register--The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as\nlisted with the maritime authorities of a country. Also, the\ncompendium of such individual ships' registrations. Registration of\na ship provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws\nof the country in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the\nnationality of the ship's ultimate owner.\n\nMoney figures: All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars\nunless otherwise indicated.\n\nNet migration rate: The balance between the number of persons\nentering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons\n(based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering the\ncountry is referred to as net immigration (3.56 migrants/1,000\npopulation); an excess of persons leaving the country as net\nemigration (-9.26 migrants/1,000 population).\n\nPopulation: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census\nbased on statistics from population censuses, vital registration\nsystems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on\nassumptions about future trends.\n\nTotal fertility rate: The average number of children that would\nbe born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing\nyears and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each age.\n\nYears: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless\nindicated as fiscal year (FY).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n                        THE WORLD FACTBOOK 1990\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCountry:  Afghanistan\n- Geography\nTotal area: 647,500 km2;

Economic considerations, however, have played\nsecond fiddle to political and military upheavals, including the nine-year\nSoviet military occupation (ended 15 February 1989) and the continuing\nbloody civil war. Over the past decade, one-third of the population has\nfled the country, with Pakistan sheltering some 3 million refugees\nand Iran perhaps 2 million. Another 1 million have probably\nmoved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan. Large numbers\nof bridges, buildings, and factories have been destroyed or\ndamaged by military action or sabotage. Government claims\nto the contrary, gross domestic product almost certainly is\nlower than 10 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital\nand the disruption of trade and transport. Official claims indicate\nthat agriculture grew by 0.7% and industry by 3.5% in 1988.\n\nGDP: $3 billion, per capita $200; real growth rate 0% (1989 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): over 50% (1989 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: NA%\n\nBudget: revenues NA;

In recent years\nAlbania has implemented limited economic reforms to stimulate its lagging\neconomy, although they do not go nearly so far as current reforms\nin the USSR and Eastern Europe. Attempts at self-reliance and a\npolicy of not borrowing from international\nlenders--sometimes overlooked in recent years--have greatly hindered the\ndevelopment of a broad economic infrastructure. Albania, however,\npossesses considerable mineral resources and is largely self-sufficient\nin food. Numerical estimates of Albanian economic activity are\nsubject to an especially wide margin of error because the government\nis isolated and closemouthed.\n\nGNP: $3.8 billion, per capita $1,200; real growth rate NA% (1989 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\n\nUnemployment rate: NA%\n\nBudget: revenues $2.3 billion;

Algeria depends on hydrocarbons for nearly all of its\nexport receipts, about 30% of government revenues, and nearly 25%\nof GDP. In 1973-74 the sharp increase in oil prices led to a booming economy\nthat helped to finance an ambitious program of industrialization. Plunging oil\nand gas prices, combined with the mismanagement of Algeria's highly centralized\neconomy, have brought the nation to its most serious social and economic crisis\nsince independence. The government has promised far-reaching reforms, including\ngiving public sector companies more autonomy, encouraging private-sector\nactivity, boosting gas and nonhydrocarbon exports, and a major overhaul\nof the banking and financial systems. In 1988 the government started to\nimplement a new economic policy to dismantle large state farms into\nprivately operated units.\n\nGDP: $54.1 billion, per capita $2,235; real growth rate - 1.8%\n(1988)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5.9% (1988)\n\nUnemployment rate: 19% (1988)\n\nBudget: revenues $17.4 billion;

Industry is\nconcentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north, although\nthe government is encouraging reinvestment in the southern region\nof Walloon. With few natural resources Belgium must import essential raw\nmaterials, making its economy closely dependent on the state of world\nmarkets. In 1988 over 70% of trade was with other EC countries. During the\nperiod 1986-88 the economy profited from falling oil prices and a lower\ndollar, which helped to improve the terms of trade. Real GDP grew\nby an average of 3.5% in 1986-89, up from 1.5% in 1985.

Agriculture today provides a livelihood for over 80% of the\npopulation, but produces only about 50% of food needs and contributes\na small 5% to GDP. The driving force behind the rapid economic growth of\nthe 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry. This sector, mostly on the\nstrength of diamonds, has gone from generating 25% of GDP in 1980 to over 50%\nin 1988. No other sector has experienced such growth, especially not\nthat of the agricultural sector, which is plagued by erratic rainfall and poor\nsoils. The unemployment rate remains a problem at 25%. A scarce resource base\nlimits diversification into labor-intensive industries.\n\nGDP: $1.87 billion, per capita $1,600; real growth rate 8.4%\n(FY88)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 11.45% (1989)\n\nUnemployment rate: 25% (1987)\n\nBudget: revenues $1,235 million;

the globe has a white\nequatorial band with the motto ORDEM E PROGRESSO (Order and Progress)\n\n- Economy\nOverview: The economy, a mixture of private enterprises of all\nsizes and extensive government intervention, experienced enormous\ndifficulties in the late 1980s, notably declining real growth, runaway\ninflation, foreign debt obligations of more than $100 billion, and\nuncertain economic policy. Government intervention includes trade and\ninvestment restrictions, wage/price controls, interest and exchange rate\ncontrols, and extensive tariff barriers. Ownership of major industrial\nfacilities is divided among private interests, the government, and\nmultinational companies. Ownership in agriculture likewise is varied,\nwith the government intervening in the politically sensitive\nissues involving large landowners and the masses of poor peasants.\nIn consultation with the IMF, the Brazilian Government has initiated\nseveral programs over the last few years to ameliorate the stagnation\nand foreign debt problems. None of these has given more than temporary\nrelief. The strategy of the new Collor government is to increase\nthe pace of privatization, encourage foreign trade and investment,\nand establish a more realistic exchange rate. One long-run strength\nis the existence of vast natural resources.\n\nGDP: $377 billion, per capita $2,500; real growth rate 3% (1989 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1,765% (1989)\n\nUnemployment rate: 2.5% (December 1989)\n\nBudget: revenues $27.8 billion;

The post-Zhivkov regime\nfaces major problems of renovating an aging industrial plant,\nkeeping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological developments,\ninvesting in additional energy capacity (the portion of electric\npower from nuclear energy reached 37% in 1988), and motivating workers,\nin part by giving them a share in the earnings of their enterprises.\nA major decree of January 1989 summarized and extended\nthe government's economic restructuring efforts, which include a partial\ndecentralization of controls over production decisions and foreign trade.\nThe new regime promises more extensive reforms and eventually a market\neconomy. But the ruling group cannot (so far) bring itself to give\nup ultimate control over economic affairs exercised through the vertical\nParty/ministerial command structure. Reforms have not\nled to improved economic performance, in particular the provision of more\nand better consumer goods.

The government reports negligible growth\nfor FY88.  The nation has been unable to achieve any significant\nimprovement in export earnings because of falling prices for many\nof its major commodity exports. For rice, traditionally the most important\nexport, the drop in world prices has been accompanied by shrinking markets\nand a smaller volume of sales.

The\neconomy is based on agriculture and related industries.  Over the\npast decade Cambodia has been slowly recovering from its near destruction\nby war and political upheaval. It still remains, however, one of the\nworld's poorest countries, with an estimated per capita GDP of about\n$130.  The food situation is precarious; during the 1980s famine has\nbeen averted only through international relief. In 1986 the production level\nof rice, the staple food crop, was able to meet only 80% of domestic needs. The\nbiggest success of the nation's recovery program has been in new rubber\nplantings and in fishing.  Industry, other than rice processing, is\nalmost nonexistent. Foreign trade is primarily with the USSR and Vietnam.\nStatistical data on the economy continues to be sparse and unreliable.\n\nGDP: $890 million, per capita $130; real growth rate 0% (1989 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: NA%\n\nBudget: revenues $NA;

Real\nGDP growth annually averaged 10% from 1978 to 1985. In 1986 Cameroon had one of\nthe highest levels of income per capita in tropical Africa, with oil revenues\npicking up the slack as growth in other sectors softened. Because of the sharp\ndrop in oil prices, however, the economy is now experiencing serious budgetary\ndifficulties and balance-of-payments disequalibrium. Oil reserves currently\nbeing exploited will be depleted in the early 1990s, so ways must be found to\nboost agricultural and industrial exports in the medium term. The Sixth\nCameroon Development Plan (1986-91) stresses balanced development and designates\nagriculture as the basis of the country's economic future.\n\nGDP: $12.9 billion, per capita $955; real growth rate - 8.6% (1988)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 8.6% (FY88)\n\nUnemployment rate: 7% (1985)\n\nBudget: revenues $2.17 billion;

Since World War II the\nimpressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has\ntransformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily\nindustrial and urban. In the 1980s Canada registered one of the highest\nrates of growth among the OECD nations, averaging about 4%. With its\ngreat natural resources, skilled labor force, and modern capital plant,\nCanada has excellent economic prospects.

To this\nend the authorities have switched to a system of household responsibility\nin agriculture in place of the old collectivization, increased the authority\nof local officials and plant managers in industry, permitted a wide\nvariety of small-scale enterprise in services and light manufacturing,\nand opened the foreign economic sector to increased trade and joint\nventures. The most gratifying result has been a strong spurt in production,\nparticularly in agriculture in the early 1980s. Otherwise, the leadership has\noften experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism\n(bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of capitalism (windfall gains\nand stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has periodically backtracked,\nretightening central controls at intervals and thereby undermining the\ncredibility of the reform process. Open inflation and excess demand continue to\nplague the economy, and political repression, following the crackdown at\nTiananmen in mid-1989, has curtailed tourism, foreign aid, and new investment\nby foreign firms. Popular resistance and changes in central policy have weakened\nChina's population control program, which is essential to the nation's long-term\neconomic viability.\n\nGNP: $NA, per capita $NA; real growth rate 4% (1989 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 19.5% (1989)\n\nUnemployment rate: 3.0% in urban areas (1989)\n\nBudget: revenues $NA;

The low educational level\nof the labor force contributes to a low level of economic activity, high\nunemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign technical assistance.\nAgriculture, including fishing and forestry, is the leading sector of the\neconomy. It contributes about 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor\nforce, and provides most of the exports. The country is not self-sufficient in\nfood production, and rice, the main staple, accounts for 90% of imports.\nDuring the period 1982-86 the industrial sector grew at an annual average rate\nof 5.3%, but its contribution to GDP was less than 4% in 1986. Despite major\ninvestment in the tourist industry, which accounts for about 25% of GDP, growth\nhas stagnated since 1983.\n\nGDP: $207 million, per capita $475; real growth rate 0.1% (1988 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 8.3% (1986)\n\nUnemployment rate: over 16% (1988 est.)\n\nBudget: revenues $75.2 million;

Sugar provides about 75% of export revenues and is mostly exported\nto the USSR and other CEMA countries. The economy has stagnated since\n1985 under a program that has deemphasized material incentives in the\nworkplace, abolished farmers' informal produce markets, and raised prices\nof government-supplied goods and services. Castro has complained that\nthe ongoing CEMA reform process has interfered with the regular flow of\ngoods to Cuba. Recently the government has been trying to increase\ntrade with Latin America and China. Cuba has had difficulty servicing\nits foreign debt since 1982. The government currently is encouraging\nforeign investment in tourist facilities. Other investment priorities\ninclude sugar, basic foods, and nickel. The annual $4 billion Soviet\nsubsidy, a main prop to Cuba's threadbare economy, may be cut in view\nof the USSR's mounting economic problems.\n\nGNP: $20.9 billion, per capita $2,000; real growth rate - 1%\n(1989 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\n\nUnemployment: 6% overall, 10% for women (1989)\n\nBudget: revenues $11.7 billion;

Overregulation holds back technical modernization and\nforeign investment. Even so, the economy grew rapidly during the late\n1970s and early 1980s, but in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices\nand an increasingly heavy burden of debt servicing led Egypt to begin\nnegotiations with the IMF for balance-of-payments support. As part of\nthe 1987 agreement with the IMF, the government agreed to institute\na reform program to reduce inflation, promote economic growth, and\nimprove its external position. The reforms have been slow in coming,\nhowever, and the economy has been largely stagnant for the past\nthree years.

A few dairy herds are kept to meet\ndomestic consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are primarily\nthose for providing winter fodder. Major sources of income are from the export\nof high-grade wool to the UK and the sale of stamps and coins. Rich stocks of\nfish in the surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders, but\ndevelopment plans called for the islands to have six trawlers by 1989.\nIn 1987 the government began to sell fishing licenses to foreign trawlers\noperating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license\nfees amount to more than $25 million per year. To encourage tourism, the\nFalkland Islands Development Corporation has built three lodges for\nvisitors who are attracted by the abundant wildlife and trout fishing.\n\nGNP: $NA, per capita $NA; real growth rate NA%\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\n\nUnemployment rate: 0%\n\nBudget: revenues $11 million; expenditures $11.8 million,\nincluding capital expenditures of $1.2 million (FY87)\n\nExports: at least $14.7 million;\ncommodities--wool, hides and skins, and other;\npartners--UK, Netherlands, Japan (1987 est.)\n\nImports: at least $13.9 million;\ncommodities--food, clothing, fuels, and machinery;\npartners--UK, Netherlands Antilles (Curacao), Japan (1987 est.)\n\nExternal debt: $NA\n\nIndustrial production: growth rate NA%\n\nElectricity: 9,200 kW capacity; 17 million kWh produced, 8,700 kWh per\ncapita (1989)\n\nIndustries: wool processing\n\nAgriculture: predominantly sheep farming; small dairy herds and\nfodder crops\n\nAid: Western (non-US) countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments\n(1970-87), $102 million\n\nCurrency: Falkland pound (plural--pounds); 1 Falkland pound\n(LF) = 100 pence\n\nExchange rates: Falkland pound (LF) per US$1--0.6055 (January 1990),\n0.6099 (1989), 0.5614 (1988), 0.6102 (1987), 0.6817 (1986), 0.7714 (1985);\nnote--the Falkland pound is at par with the British pound\n\nFiscal year: 1 April-31 March\n\n- Communications\nHighways: 510 km total; 30 km paved, 80 km gravel, and 400 km unimproved\nearth\n\nPorts: Port Stanley\n\nCivil air: no major transport aircraft\n\nAirports: 5 total, 5 usable; 2 with permanent-surface runways;\nnone with runways over 3,659 m; 1 with runways 2,440-3,659 m;\nnone with runways 1,220 to 2,439 m\n\nTelecommunications: government-operated radiotelephone and private\nVHF/CB radio networks provide effective service to almost all points on\nboth islands; 590 telephones; stations--2 AM, 3 FM, no TV; 1 Atlantic Ocean\nINTELSAT earth station with links through London to other countries\n\n- Defense Forces\nNote: defense is the responsibility of the UK\n----------------------------------------------------\nCountry:  Faroe Islands\n(part of the Danish realm)\n- Geography\nTotal area: 1,400 km2; land area: 1,400 km2\n\nComparative area: slightly less than eight times the size of\nWashington, DC\n\nLand boundaries: none\n\nCoastline: 764 km\n\nMaritime claims:\n\nContiguous zone: 4 nm;\n\nContinental shelf: 200 meters or to depth of exploitation;\n\nExclusive fishing zone: 200 nm;\n\nTerritorial sea: 3 nm\n\nClimate: mild winters, cool summers; usually overcast; foggy, windy\n\nTerrain: rugged, rocky, some low peaks; cliffs along most of coast\n\nNatural resources: fish\n\nLand use: 2% arable land; 0% permanent crops; 0% meadows and pastures;\n0% forest and woodland; 98% other\n\nEnvironment: precipitous terrain limits habitation to small coastal\nlowlands; archipelago of 18 inhabited islands and a few uninhabited\nislets\n\nNote: strategically located along important sea lanes in\nnortheastern Atlantic about midway between Iceland and Shetland Islands\n\n- People\nPopulation: 47,715 (July 1990), growth rate 0.9% (1990)\n\nBirth rate: 17 births/1,000 population (1990)\n\nDeath rate: 8 deaths/1,000 population (1990)\n\nNet migration rate: 0 migrants/1,000 population (1990)\n\nInfant mortality rate: 9 deaths/1,000 live births (1990)\n\nLife expectancy at birth: 74 years male, 81 years female (1990)\n\nTotal fertility rate: 2.2 children born/woman (1990)\n\nNationality: noun--Faroese (sing., pl.); adjective--Faroese\n\nEthnic divisions: homogeneous Scandinavian population\n\nReligion: Evangelical Lutheran\n\nLanguage: Faroese (derived from Old Norse), Danish\n\nLiteracy: 99%\n\nLabor force: 17,585; largely engaged in fishing, manufacturing,\ntransportation, and commerce\n\nOrganized labor: NA\n\n- Government\nLong-form name: none\n\nType: part of the Danish realm; self-governing overseas\nadministrative division of Denmark\n\nCapital: Torshavn\n\nAdministrative divisions: none (self-governing overseas\nadministrative division of Denmark)\n\nIndependence: part of the Danish realm; self-governing overseas\nadministrative division of Denmark\n\nConstitution: Danish\n\nLegal system: Danish\n\nNational holiday: Birthday of the Queen, 16 April (1940)\n\nExecutive branch: Danish monarch, high commissioner, prime minister,\ndeputy prime minister, Cabinet (Landsstyri)\n\nLegislative branch: unicameral Parliament (Logting)\n\nJudicial branch: none\n\nLeaders:\nChief of State--Queen MARGRETHE II (since 14 January 1972), represented by\nHigh Commissioner Bent KLINTE (since NA);\n\nHead of Government--Prime Minister Jogvan SUNDSTEIN (since 17 January\n1989)\n\nPolitical parties and leaders: four-party ruling\ncoalition--People's Party, Jogvan Sundstein; Republican Party,\nSigner Hansen; Progressive and Fishing Industry Party combined with the\nChristian People's Party (CPP-PFIP); Home Rule Party, Hilmar Kass;\nopposition--Social Democratic Party, Atli P.

Sugar exports are a major source of foreign exchange\nand sugar processing accounts for one-third of industrial output.\nIndustry, including sugar milling, contributes 10% to GDP. Fiji\ntraditionally earned considerable sums of hard currency from the 250,000\ntourists who visited each year. In 1987, however, after two military\ncoups, the economy went into decline. GDP dropped by 7.8% in\n1987 and by another 2.5% in 1988; political uncertainly created a drop in\ntourism, and the worst drought of the century caused sugar production\nto fall sharply. In contrast, sugar and tourism turned in strong\nperformances in 1989, and the economy rebounded vigorously.\n\nGDP: $1.32 billion, per capita $1,750; real growth rate 12.5%\n(1989 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 11.8% (1988)\n\nUnemployment rate: 11% (1988)\n\nBudget: revenues $260 million;

Trade is important, with the\nexport of goods representing about 25% of GNP. Except for timber and\nseveral minerals, Finland depends on imported raw materials, energy, and\nsome components of manufactured goods. Because of the climate, agricultural\ndevelopment is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic commodities.\nEconomic prospects are generally bright, the main shadow being the\nincreasing pressures on wages and prices.\n\nGDP: $74.4 billion, per capita $15,000;

Large tracts of fertile land, the application of modern\ntechnology, and subsidies have combined to make it the leading agricultural\nproducer in Western Europe. France is largely self-sufficient in agricultural\nproducts and is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products. The industrial\nsector generates about one-third of GDP and employs about one-third of the work\nforce. During the period 1982-86 economic growth was sluggish, averaging\nonly 1.4% annually. This trend was reversed by late 1987, however,\nwith a strong expansion of consumer demand, followed by a surge in\ninvestment. The economy has had difficulty generating enough jobs for new\nentrants into the labor force, resulting in a high unemployment rate,\nbut the upward trend in growth recently pushed the jobless rate below 10%.\nThe steadily advancing economic integration within the European\nCommunity is a major force affecting the fortunes of the various economic\nsectors.\n\nGDP: $819.6 billion, per capita $14,600;

During the period 1981-85 oil\naccounted for about 46% of GDP, 83% of export earnings, and 65% of government\nrevenues on average. The high oil prices of the early 1980s contributed to a\nsubstantial increase in per capita income, stimulated domestic demand,\nreinforced migration from rural to urban areas, and raised the level of real\nwages to among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The three-year slide of\nGabon's economy, which began with falling oil prices in 1985, stabilized\nin 1989 because of a near doubling of oil prices over their 1988 lows.\nThe agricultural and industrial sectors are relatively underdeveloped,\naccounting for only 8% and 10%, respectively, of GDP in 1986.\n\nGDP: $3.2 billion, per capita $3,200;

It is one of the world's\npoorest countries with a per capita income of about $250. About 75% of\nthe population is engaged in crop production and livestock raising, which\ncontributes about 30% to GDP. Small-scale manufacturing\nactivity--processing peanuts, fish, and hides--accounts for less than\n10% of GDP. Tourism is a growing industry. The Gambia imports about 33%\nof its food, all fuel, and most manufactured goods. Exports are\nconcentrated on peanut products (over 75% of total value).\n\nGDP: $195 million, per capita $250; real growth rate 4.6% (FY89 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 8.0% (FY89 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: NA%\n\nBudget: revenues $75 million; expenditures $67 million, including\ncapital expenditures of $21 million (FY89)\n\nExports: $133 million (f.o.b., FY89);\ncommodities--peanuts and peanut products, fish, cotton lint, palm kernels;\npartners--Ghana 49%, Europe 27%, Japan 12%, US 1% (1986)\n\nImports: $105 million (c.i.f., FY89);\ncommodities--foodstuffs, manufactures, raw materials, fuel, machinery\nand transport equipment;\npartners--Europe 55% (EC 39%, other 16%), Asia 20%, US 11%, Senegal 4%\n(1986)\n\nExternal debt: $330 million (December 1989 est.)\n\nIndustrial production: growth rate 7.3% (FY88)\n\nElectricity: 29,000 kW capacity; 64 million kWh produced, 80 kWh per\ncapita (1989)\n\nIndustries: peanut processing, tourism, beverages, agricultural\nmachinery assembly, woodworking, metalworking, clothing\n\nAgriculture: accounts for 30% of GDP and employs about 75% of the\npopulation; imports one-third of food requirements; major export crop is\npeanuts; the principal crops--millet, sorghum, rice, corn, cassava,\npalm kernels; livestock--cattle, sheep, and goats; forestry and fishing\nresources not fully exploited\n\nAid: US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-88), $84 million; Western\n(non-US) countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-87), $422 million;\nCommunist countries (1970-88), $39 million\n\nCurrency: dalasi (plural--dalasi); 1 dalasi (D) = 100 bututs\n\nExchange rates: dalasi (D) per US$1--8.3232 (December 1989),\n7.5846 (1989), 6.7086 (1988), 7.0744 (1987), 6.9380 (1986), 3.8939 (1985)\n\nFiscal year: 1 July-30 June\n\n- Communications\nHighways: 3,083 km total; 431 km paved, 501 km gravel/laterite, and 2,151\nkm unimproved earth\n\nInland waterways: 400 km\n\nPorts: Banjul\n\nCivil air: 2 major transport aircraft\n\nAirports: 1 with permanent-surface runway 2,440-3,659 m\n\nTelecommunications: adequate network of radio relay and wire; 3,500\ntelephones; stations--3 AM, 2 FM, 1 TV; 1 Atlantic Ocean INTELSAT earth station\n\n- Defense Forces\nBranches: Army, paramilitary Gendarmerie\n\nMilitary manpower: males 15-49, 182,308; 92,001 fit for military service\n\nDefense expenditures: NA\n----------------------------------------------------\nCountry:  Gaza Strip\nNote: The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with\nIsrael in control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan\nHeights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by President\nReagan's 1 September 1982 peace initiative, the final status of the West\nBank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a peace\ntreaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the concerned\nparties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will resolve the\nrespective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process, it is US policy\nthat the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be\ndetermined. In the view of the US, the term West Bank describes all of the area\nwest of the Jordan under Jordanian administration before the 1967 Arab-Israeli\nwar. With respect to negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement, however,\nit is US policy that a distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest\nof the West Bank because of the city's special status and circumstances.\nTherefore, a negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be\ndifferent in character from that of the rest of the West Bank.\n\n- Geography\nTotal area: 380km2; land area: 380 km2\n\nComparative area: slightly more than twice the size of Washington, DC\n\nLand boundaries: 62 km total; Egypt 11 km, Israel 51 km\n\nCoastline: 40 km\n\nMaritime claims: Israeli occupied with status to be determined\n\nDisputes: Israeli occupied with status to be determined\n\nClimate: temperate, mild winters, dry and warm to hot summers\n\nTerrain: flat to rolling, sand and dune covered coastal plain\n\nNatural resources: negligible\n\nLand use: 13% arable land, 32% permanent crops, 0% meadows and pastures,\n0% forest and woodland, 55% other\n\nEnvironment: desertification\n\nNote: there are 18 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip\n\n- People\nPopulation: 615,575 (July 1990), growth rate 3.2% (1990); in addition,\nthere are 2,500 Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip\n\nBirth rate: 47 births/1,000 population (1990)\n\nDeath rate: 7 deaths/1,000 population (1990)\n\nNet migration rate: - 7 migrants/1,000 population (1990)\n\nInfant mortality rate: 55 deaths/1,000 live births (1990)\n\nLife expectancy at birth: 63 years male, 66 years female (1990)\n\nTotal fertility rate: 7.0 children born/woman (1990)\n\nNationality: NA\n\nEthnic divisions: 99.8% Palestinian Arab and other, 0.2% Jewish\n\nReligion: 99% Muslim (predominantly Sunni), 0.7% Christian, 0.3% Jewish\n\nLanguage: Arabic, Israeli settlers speak Hebrew, English widely\nunderstood\n\nLiteracy: NA%\n\nLabor force: (excluding Israeli Jewish settlers) 32.0% small industry,\ncommerce and business, 24.4% construction, 25.5% service and other, and\n18.1% agriculture (1984)\n\nOrganized labor: NA\n\n- Government\nLong-form name: none\n\nNote: The Gaza Strip is currently governed by Israeli military authorities\nand Israeli civil administration.

The\nonce dominant agricultural sector now contributes only 13% to GNP, about the\nsame as that of the construction sector, and industry accounts for 7%. Gaza\ndepends upon Israel for 90% of its imports and as a market for 80% of its\nexports. Unrest in the territory in 1988-89 (intifadah) has raised\nunemployment and substantially lowered the incomes of the population.\n\nGNP: $380 million, per capita $650; real growth rate NA% (1988)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\n\nUnemployment rate: NA%\n\nBudget: revenues $36.6 million;

As the 1990s begin, economic integration with West Germany\nappears inevitable, beginning with the establishment of a common\ncurrency. The opening of the border with the FRG in late 1989 and the\ncontinuing emigration of hundreds of thousands of skilled workers had\nbrought growth to a standstill by yearend 1989. Features of the old\neconomic regime that will quickly change: (a) the collectivization\nof 95% of East German farms; (b) state ownership of nearly all\ntransportation facilities, industrial plants, foreign trade\norganizations, and financial institutions; (c) the 65% share in trade\nof the USSR and other CEMA countries; and (d) the detailed control over\neconomic details exercised by Party and state. Once integrated into\nthe thriving West German economy, the area will have to stem the\noutflow of workers and renovate the obsolescent industrial base. After an\ninitial readjustment period, living standards and quality of output will\nsteadily rise toward West German levels.\n\nGNP: $159.5 billion, per capita $9,679; real growth rate 1.2%\n(1989 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA\n\nUnemployment rate: NA%\n\nBudget: revenues $123.5 billion;

The FRG is\npoor in natural resources, coal being the most important\nmineral. The FRG's comparative advantage lies in the technologically\nadvanced production stages. Thus manufacturing and services dominate\neconomic activity, and raw materials and semimanufactures constitute\na large proportion of imports. In 1988 manufacturing accounted for\n35% of GDP, with other sectors contributing lesser amounts.  The major\neconomic problem in 1989 is persistent unemployment of over 8%. The FRG is well\npoised to take advantage of the increasing economic integration of the European\nCommunity. The dramatic opening of the boundary with East Germany in late 1989\nposes new economic challenges that could tax even this powerful economy.\n\nGDP: $945.7 billion, per capita $15,300; real growth rate 4.3% (1989 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3.0% (1989)\n\nUnemployment rate: 8.4% (1989)\n\nBudget: revenues $539 billion;

Moves toward privatization\nand relaxation of government controls continued in 1988-89, although at a\nslower-than-expected pace. In 1988 service on the $2.8 billion debt was\nequivalent to 75% of export earnings. As Ghana obtains concessional loans\nand pays off high-interest debt, however, debt service is expected to fall\nbelow 30% of export earnings in the early 1990s. The economic rebuilding\nprogram has both helped and harmed the manufacturing sector, for example,\nby improving the supply of raw materials and by increasing competition from\nimports. The long-term outlook is favorable provided that the political\nstructure can endure the slow pace at which living standards are improving\nand can manage the problems stemming from excessive population growth.\n\nGNP: $5.2 billion, per capita $400;

Like many other Western economies, Greece\nsuffered severely from the global oil price hikes of the 1970s, annual\nGDP growth plunging from 8% to 2% in the 1980s, and inflation,\nunemployment, and budget deficits rising sharply. The fall of the\nsocialist government in 1989 and the inability of the conservative\nopposition to muster a clear majority have led to business uncertainty\nand the continued prospects for lackluster economic performance.\nOnce the political situation is sorted out, Greece will have to face the\nchallenges posed by the steadily increasing integration of the European\nCommunity, including the progressive lowering of tariff barriers. Tourism\ncontinues as a major industry, providing a vital offset to the sizable\ncommodity trade deficit.\n\nGDP: $56.3 billion, per capita $5,605; real growth rate 2.3% (1989\nest.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 14.8% (December 1989)\n\nUnemployment rate: 7.7% (1988)\n\nBudget: revenues $15.5 billion;

Natural resources are limited and food and raw materials must\nbe imported. Manufacturing is the backbone of the economy, accounting\nfor more than 20% of GDP, employing 36% of the labor force, and exporting about\n90% of output. Real GDP growth averaged a remakable 8% in 1987-88, then\nslowed to a respectable 3% in 1989. Unemployment, which has been declining since\nthe mid-1980s, is now less than 2%. A shortage of labor continues to put upward\npressure on prices and the cost of living. Short-term prospects remain\nsolid so long as major trading partners continue to be prosperous. The\ncrackdown in China in 1989 casts a long shadow over the longer term\neconomic outlook.\n\nGDP: $57 billion, per capita $10,000; real growth rate 3% (1989)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 9.5% (1989)\n\nUnemployment rate: 1.6% (1988)\n\nBudget: $6.9 billion (FY89)\n\nExports: $63.2 billion (f.o.b., 1988), including reexports of\n$22.9 billion;\ncommodities--clothing, textile yarn and fabric, footwear, electrical\nappliances, watches and clocks, toys;\npartners--US 31%, China 14%, FRG 8%, UK 6%, Japan 5%\n\nImports: $63.9 billion (c.i.f., 1988);\ncommodities--foodstuffs, transport equipment, raw materials,\nsemimanufactures, petroleum;\npartners--China 31%, Japan 20%, Taiwan 9%, US 8%\n\nExternal debt: $9.6 billion (December 1988)\n\nIndustrial production: growth rate 7.0% (1988)\n\nElectricity: 7,800,000 kW capacity;

The share\nof the labor force in agriculture dropped from over 50% in 1950 to under\n20% in 1989. Agriculture nevertheless remains an important sector,\nproviding sizable export earnings and meeting domestic food needs.\nIndustry accounts for about 40% of GNP and 30% of employment. Nearly\nthree-fourths of foreign trade is with the USSR and Eastern Europe.  Low\nrates of growth reflect the inability of the Soviet-style economy to\nmodernize capital plant and motivate workers. GNP grew about 1% in 1988\nand declined by 1% in 1989. Since 1985 external debt has\nmore than doubled, to nearly $20 billion. In recent years Hungary has\nmoved further than any other East European country in experimenting with\ndecentralized and market-oriented enterprises. These experiments have\nfailed to jump-start the economy because of: limitations on funds for\nprivatization; continued subsidization of insolvent state enterprises;\nand the leadership's reluctance to implement sweeping market reforms\nthat would cause additional social dislocations in the short term.\n\nGNP: $64.6 billion, per capita $6,108;

The economy is heavily dependent on\nthe fishing industry, which provides nearly 75% of export earnings. In the\nabsence of other natural resources, Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing\nworld fish prices. National output declined for the second consecutive year in\n1989, and two of the largest fish farms filed for bankruptcy. Other economic\nactivities include livestock raising and aluminum smelting. A fall in the fish\ncatch is expected for 1990, resulting in a continuation of the recession.\n\nGDP: $4.0 billion, per capita $16,200; real growth rate - 1.8% (1989 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 17.4% (1989 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: 1.3% (1989 est.)\n\nBudget: revenues $1.5 billion;

It presents both the\nentrepreneurial skills and drives of the capitalist system and\nwidespread government intervention of the socialist mold. Growth of 4%\nto 5% annually in the 1980s has softened the impact of population growth\non unemployment, social tranquility, and the environment. Agricultural output\nhas continued to expand, reflecting the greater use of modern farming techniques\nand improved seed that have helped to make India self-sufficient in food grains\nand a net agricultural exporter. However, tens of millions of villagers,\nparticularly in the south, have not benefited from the green\nrevolution and live in abject poverty. Industry has benefited from a\nliberalization of controls.

Fish from the ocean are of growing\neconomic importance to many of the bordering countries as a source of both food\nand exports. Fishing fleets from the USSR, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit\nthe Indian Ocean for mostly shrimp and tuna.

Indonesia has extensive natural wealth but, with a large and\nrapidly increasing population, it remains a poor country. GNP growth in 1985-89\naveraged about 4%, somewhat short of the 5% rate needed to absorb the 2.3\nmillion workers annually entering the labor force. Agriculture, including\nforestry and fishing, is the most important sector, accounting for 21% of GDP\nand over 50% of the labor force. The staple crop is rice. Once the world's\nlargest rice importer, Indonesia is now nearly self-sufficient.\nPlantation crops--rubber and palm oil--are being encouraged for both\nexport and job generation. The diverse natural resources include crude\noil, natural gas, timber, metals, and coal. Of these, the oil sector\ndominates the external economy, generating more than 20% of the\ngovernment's revenues and 40% of export earnings in 1989.\nJapan is Indonesia's most important customer and supplier of aid.\n\nGNP: $80 billion, per capita $430;

War-related disruptions, massive corruption,\nmismanagement, demographic pressures, and ideological rigidities have kept\neconomic growth at depressed levels. Oil accounts for 90% of export\nrevenues. A combination of war damage and low oil prices brought a 2%\ndrop in GNP in 1988. GNP probably rose slightly in 1989, considerably\nshort of the 3.4% population growth rate in 1989. Heating oil and gasoline\nare rationed. Agriculture has suffered from the war, land reform, and shortages\nof equipment and materials. The five-year plan seeks to reinvigorate the\neconomy by increasing the role of the private sector, boosting nonoil\nincome, and securing foreign loans. The plan is overly ambitious but\nprobably will generate some short-term relief.\n\nGNP: $97.6 billion, per capita $1,800; real growth rate 0-1% (1989)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 50-80% (1989)\n\nUnemployment rate: 30% (1989)\n\nBudget: revenues $NA;

The economy is dominated by the oil sector, which provides\nabout 95% of foreign exchange earnings. Since the early 1980s financial\nproblems, caused by war expenditures and damage to oil export facilities by\nIran, have led the government to implement austerity measures and to reschedule\nforeign debt payments. Oil exports have gradually increased with the\nconstruction of new pipelines. Agricultural development remains hampered by\nlabor shortages, salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land reform\nand collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although accorded high\npriority by the government, is under financial constraints. New investment funds\nare generally allocated only to projects that result in import substitution or\nforeign exchange earnings.\n\nGNP: $35 billion, per capita $1,940; real growth rate 5%\n(1989 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 30-40% (1989 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: less than 5% (1989 est.)\n\nBudget: revenues $NA billion;

It depends on imports for crude oil, food, grains, raw materials,\nand military equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has developed\nits agriculture and industry sectors on an intensive scale over the past 20\nyears. Industry accounts for about 23% of the labor force, agriculture for 6%,\nand services for most of the balance. Diamonds, high-technology\nmachinery, and agricultural products (fruits and vegetables) are the\nbiggest export earners. The balance of payments has traditionally\nbeen negative, but is offset by large transfer payments and foreign loans.\nNearly two-thirds of Israel's $16 billion external debt is owed to\nthe US, which is its major source for economic and military aid.\nTo earn needed foreign exchange, Israel must continue to exploit\nhigh-technology niches in the international market, such as medical\nscanning equipment. In 1987 the economy showed a 5.2% growth in real GNP, the\nbest gain in nearly a decade; in 1988-89 the gain was only 1% annually,\nlargely because of the economic impact of the Palestinian uprising\n(intifadah).

Since\n1986 an economic recovery has been under way. In 1987 conditions began to\nimprove for the bauxite and alumina industry because of increases in world metal\nprices. The recovery has also been supported by growth in the manufacturing and\ntourism sectors. In September 1988, Hurricane Gilbert inflicted severe\ndamage on crops and the electric power system, a sharp but temporary\nsetback to the economy. By October 1989 the economic recovery from the\nhurricane was largely complete and real growth was up about 3% for 1989.\n\nGDP: $3.8 billion, per capita $1,529; real growth rate 3.0% (1989\nest.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 15% (1989)\n\nUnemployment rate: 18.7% (1988)\n\nBudget: revenues $1.1 billion; expenditures $1.5 billion, including\ncapital expenditures of $NA (FY88 est.)\n\nExports: $948 million (f.o.b., 1989 est.);\ncommodities--bauxite, alumina, sugar, bananas;\npartners--US 40%, UK, Canada, Trinidad and Tobago, Norway\n\nImports: $1.6 billion (c.i.f., 1989 est.); commodities--petroleum,\nmachinery, food, consumer goods, construction goods; partners--US 46%,\nUK, Venezuela, Canada, Japan, Trinidad and Tobago\n\nExternal debt: $4.4 billion (1989 est.)\n\nIndustrial production: growth rate 3% (1989 est.)\n\nElectricity: 1,437,000 kW capacity; 2,390 million kWh produced,\n960 kWh per capita (1989)\n\nIndustries: tourism, bauxite mining, textiles, food processing,\nlight manufactures\n\nAgriculture: accounts for about 9% of GDP, one-third of work force, and\n17% of exports; commercial crops--sugarcane, bananas, coffee, citrus, potatoes,\nand vegetables; livestock and livestock products include poultry, goats, milk;\nnot self-sufficient in grain, meat, and dairy products\n\nIllicit drugs: illicit cultivation of cannabis has decreased, with\nproduction shifting from large to small plots and nurseries to evade\naerial detection and eradication\n\nAid: US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-88), $1.1 billion; Western\n(non-US) countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-87), $1.2 billion;\nOPEC bilateral aid (1979-89), $27 million; Communist countries (1974-88),\n$349 million\n\nCurrency: Jamaican dollar (plural--dollars);\n1 Jamaican dollar (J$) = 100 cents\n\nExchange rates: Jamaican dollars (J$) per US$1--6.5013 (January 1990),\n5.7446 (1989), 5.4886 (1988), 5.4867 (1987), 5.4778 (1986), 5.5586 (1985)\n\nFiscal year: 1 April-31 March\n\n- Communications\nRailroads: 370 km, all 1.435-meter standard gauge, single track\n\nHighways: 18,200 km total; 12,600 km paved, 3,200 km gravel, 2,400 km\nimproved earth\n\nPipelines: refined products, 10 km\n\nPorts: Kingston, Montego Bay\n\nMerchant marine: 5 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 13,048 GRT/21,412\nDWT; includes 1 cargo, 1 container, 1 roll-on/roll-off cargo, 1 petroleum, oils,\nand lubricants (POL) tanker, 1 bulk\n\nCivil air: 6 major transport aircraft\n\nAirports: 41 total, 25 usable; 14 with permanent-surface runways;\nnone with runways over 3,659 m; 2 with runways 2,440-3,659 m; 2 with\nrunways 1,220-2,439 m\n\nTelecommunications: fully automatic domestic telephone network;\n127,000 telephones; stations--10 AM, 17 FM, 8 TV; 2 Atlantic Ocean INTELSAT\nearth stations; 3 coaxial submarine cables\n\n- Defense Forces\nBranches: Jamaica Defense Force (includes Coast Guard and Air Wing)\n\nMilitary manpower: males 15-49, 620,400; 440,967 fit for military service;\nno conscription; 27,014 reach minimum volunteer age (18) annually\n\nDefense expenditures: 1.1% of GDP (1987)\n----------------------------------------------------\nCountry:  Jan Mayen\n(territory of Norway)\n- Geography\nTotal area: 373 km2; land area: 373 km2\n\nComparative area: slightly more than twice the size of Washington, DC\n\nLand boundaries: none\n\nCoastline: 124.1 km\n\nMaritime claims:\n\nContiguous zone: 10 nm;\n\nContinental shelf: 200 meters or to depth of exploitation;\n\nExclusive fishing zone: 200 nm;\n\nTerritorial sea: 4 nm\n\nDisputes: Denmark has challenged Norway's maritime claims beween\nGreenland and Jan Mayen\n\nClimate: arctic maritime with frequent storms and persistent fog\n\nTerrain: volcanic island, partly covered by glaciers; Beerenberg is the\nhighest peak, with an elevation of 2,277 meters\n\nNatural resources: none\n\nLand use: 0% arable land; 0% permanent crops; 0% meadows and\npastures; 0% forest and woodland; 100% other\n\nEnvironment: barren volcanic island with some moss and grass;\nvolcanic activity resumed in 1970\n\nNote: located 590 km north-northwest of Iceland between\nthe Greenland Sea and the Norwegian Sea north of the Arctic Circle\n\n- People\nPopulation: no permanent inhabitants\n\n- Government\nLong-form name: none\n\nType: territory of Norway\n\nNote: administered by a governor (sysselmann) resident in Longyearbyen\n(Svalbard)\n\n- Economy\nOverview: Jan Mayen is a volcanic island with no exploitable\nnatural resources.

Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, and a\ncomparatively small defense allocation have helped Japan advance rapidly,\nnotably in high-technology fields. Industry, the most important sector of the\neconomy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and fuels.\nSelf-sufficent in rice, Japan must import 50% of its requirements for other\ngrain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing\nfleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the total global catch. Overall\neconomic growth has been spectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5%\naverage in the 1970s and 1980s.

Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are\nimportant export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy\ncattle is known worldwide and represents an important export earner. Milk\nproducts go to the UK and other EC countries. In 1986 the finance sector\novertook tourism as the main contributor to GDP, accounting for 40% of the\nisland's output. In recent years the government has encouraged light industry\nto locate in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry has developed\nalongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw material\nand energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of Jersey's food\nneeds.\n\nGDP: $NA, per capita $NA; real growth rate 8% (1987 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 8% (1988 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: NA%\n\nBudget: revenues $308.0 million; expenditures $284.4 million, including\ncapital expenditures of NA (1985)\n\nExports: $NA; commodities--light industrial and electrical goods,\nfoodstuffs, textiles; partners--UK\n\nImports: $NA; commodities--machinery and transport equipment,\nmanufactured goods, foodstuffs, mineral fuels, chemicals; partners--UK\n\nExternal debt: $NA\n\nIndustrial production: growth rate NA%\n\nElectricity: 50,000 kW standby capacity (1989); power supplied by France\n\nIndustries: tourism, banking and finance, dairy\n\nAgriculture: potatoes, cauliflowers, tomatoes; dairy and cattle farming\n\nAid: none\n\nCurrency: Jersey pound (plural--pounds); 1 Jersey pound (LJ) = 100 pence\n\nExchange rates: Jersey pounds (LJ) per US$1--0.6055 (January 1990),\n0.6099 (1989), 0.5614 (1988), 0.6102 (1987), 0.6817 (1986), 0.7714 (1985);\nthe Jersey pound is at par with the British pound\n\nFiscal year: 1 April-31 March\n\n- Communications\nPorts: Saint Helier, Gorey, St. Aubin\n\nAirports: 1 with permanent-surface runway 1,220-2,439 m (St. Peter)\n\nTelecommunications: 63,700 telephones; stations--1 AM, no FM, 1\nTV; 3 submarine cables\n\n- Defense Forces\nNote: defense is the responsibility of the UK\n----------------------------------------------------\nCountry:  Johnston Atoll\n(territory of the US)\n- Geography\nTotal area: 2.8 km2; land area: 2.8 km2\n\nComparative area: about 4.7 times the size of The Mall in Washington, DC\n\nLand boundaries: none\n\nCoastline: 10 km\n\nMaritime claims:\n\nContiguous zone: 12 nm;\n\nContinental shelf: 200 m;\n\nExtended economic zone: 200 nm;\n\nTerritorial sea: 12 nm\n\nClimate: tropical, but generally dry; consistent northeast trade winds\nwith little seasonal temperature variation\n\nTerrain: mostly flat with a maximum elevation of 4 meters\n\nNatural resources: guano (deposits worked until about 1890)\n\nLand use: 0% arable land; 0% permanent crops; 0% meadows and pastures;\n0% forest and woodland; 100% other\n\nEnvironment: some low-growing vegetation\n\nNote: strategic location 1,328 km west-southwest of Honolulu in the North\nPacific Ocean, about one-third of the way between Hawaii and the Marshall\nIslands; Johnston Island and Sand Island are natural islands; North Island\n(Akau) and East Island (Hikina) are manmade islands formed from coral\ndredging; closed to the public; former nuclear weapons test site\n\n- People\nPopulation: 1,203 (December 1989); all US government personnel and\ncontractors\n\n- Government\nLong-form name: none (territory of the US)\n\nType: unincorporated territory of the US administered by the US Defense\nNuclear Agency (DNA) and managed cooperatively by DNA and the Fish and Wildlife\nService of the US Department of the Interior as part of the National Wildlife\nRefuge system\n\nDiplomatic representation: none (territory of the US)\n\nFlag: the flag of the US is used\n\n- Economy\nOverview: Economic activity is limited to providing services to\nUS military personnel and contractors located on the island.

Recent\nyears, however, have witnessed a sharp reduction in cash aid from Arab\noil-producing countries and in worker remittances, with growth averaging\n1-2%. Imports--mainly oil, capital goods, consumer durables, and\nfoodstuffs--have been outstripping exports by roughly $2 billion annually,\nthe difference being made up by aid, remittances, and borrowing. In 1989\nthe government pursued policies to encourage private investment, curb\nimports of luxury goods, promote exports, reduce the budget deficit, and, in\ngeneral, reinvigorate economic growth. Success will depend largely on\nexogenous forces, such as the absence of drought and a pickup in outside\nsupport. Down the road, the completion of the proposed Unity Dam on the\nYarmuk is vital to meet rapidly growing requirements for water.\n\nGNP: $5.2 billion, per capita $1,760; real growth rate 0% (1989)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 35% (1989 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: 9-10% (December 1989 est.)\n\nBudget: revenues $0.92 billion;

Phosphate deposits were\nexhausted at the time of independence in 1979. Copra and fish now represent\nthe bulk of production and exports. The economy has fluctuated widely in\nrecent years. Real GDP declined about 8% in 1987, as the fish catch fell\nsharply to only one-fourth the level of 1986 and copra production was hampered\nby repeated rains. Output rebounded strongly in 1988, with real GDP growing\nby 17%. The upturn in economic growth came from an increase in copra production\nand a good fish catch. Following the strong surge in output in 1988, GDP\nremained about the same in 1989.\n\nGDP: $34 million, per capita $500; real growth rate 0% (1989)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3.1% (1988)\n\nUnemployment rate: 2% (1985);

and state-owned industry produces 95% of\nmanufactured goods. State control of economic affairs is unusually tight\neven for a Communist country because of the small size and homogeneity of\nthe society and the strict one-man rule of Kim. Economic growth during\nthe period 1984-89 has averaged approximately 3%. Abundant natural resources\nand hydropower form the basis of industrial development. Output of the\nextractive industries includes coal, iron ore, magnesite, graphite, copper,\nzinc, lead, and precious metals. Manufacturing emphasis is centered on heavy\nindustry, with light industry lagging far behind. The use of high-yielding\nseed varieties, expansion of irrigation, and the heavy use of fertilizers\nhave enabled North Korea to become largely self-sufficient in food production.\nNorth Korea, however, is far behind South Korea in economic development and\nliving standards.\n\nGNP: $28 billion, per capita $1,240;

GNP increased almost 13% in both\n1986 and 1987 and 12% in 1988 before slowing to 6.5% in 1989. Such a\nrapid rate of growth was achieved with an inflation rate of only 3% in the\nperiod 1986-87, rising to 7% in 1988 and 5% in 1989. Unemployment is\nalso low, and some labor bottlenecks have appeared in several processing\nindustries. While the South Korean economy is expected to grow at more\nthan 5% annually during the 1990s, labor unrest--which led to\nsubstantial wage hikes in 1987-89--threatens to undermine\nnoninflationary growth.\n\nGNP: $200 billion, per capita $4,600;

Of the countries in the\nMiddle East, Kuwait has oil reserves second only to those of Saudi Arabia.\nEarnings from hydrocarbons generate over 90% of both export and government\nrevenues and contribute about 40% to GDP. Most of the nonoil sector is dependent\nupon oil-derived government revenues to provide infrastructure development and\nto promote limited industrial diversification. The economy is heavily dependent\nupon foreign labor--Kuwaitis account for less than 20% of the labor force. The\nearly years of the Iran-Iraq war pushed Kuwait's GDP well below its 1980 peak;\nhowever, during the period 1986-88, GDP increased each year, rising to 5% in\n1988.\n\nGDP: $20.5 billion, per capita $10,500;

The cease-fire established in October\n1976 between the domestic political groups generally held for about six\nyears, despite occasional fighting. Syrian troops constituted as the Arab\nDeterrent Force by the Arab League have remained in Lebanon. Syria's\nmove toward supporting the Lebanese Muslims and the Palestinians and\nIsrael's growing support for Lebanese Christians brought the two sides\ninto rough equilibrium, but no progress was made toward national\nreconciliation or political reforms--the original cause of the war.\n\n   Continuing Israeli concern about the Palestinian presence in\nLebanon led to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982. Israeli\nforces occupied all of the southern portion of the country and mounted a\nsummer-long siege of Beirut, which resulted in the evacuation of the\nPLO from Beirut in September under the supervision of a multinational\nforce (MNF) made up of US, French, and Italian troops.\n\n   Within days of the departure of the MNF, Lebanon's newly elected\npresident, Bashir Gemayel, was assassinated. In the wake of his death,\nChristian militiamen massacred hundreds of Palestinian refugees in two\nBeirut camps. This prompted the return of the MNF to ease the security\nburden on Lebanon's weak Army and security forces. In late March 1984\nthe last MNF units withdrew.\n\n   Lebanese Parliamentarians met in Taif, Saudi Arabia in late 1989 and\nconcluded a national reconciliation pact that codified a new power-sharing\nformula, specifiying a Christian president but giving Muslims more\nauthority. Rene Muawad was subsequently elected president on 4 November\n1989, ending a 13-month period during which Lebanon had no president and\nrival Muslim and Christian governments. Muawad was assassinated\n17 days later, on 22 November; on 24 November Elias Harawi was\nelected to succeed Muawad.\n\n   Progress toward lasting political compromise in Lebanon has been\nstalled by opposition from Christian strongman Gen. Michel Awn.\nAwn--appointed acting Prime Minister by outgoing president Amin Gemayel\nin September 1988--called the national reconciliation accord\nillegitimate and has refused to recognize the new Lebanese Government.\n\n   Lebanon continues to be partially occupied by Syrian troops. Syria\naugmented its troop presence during the weeks following Muawad's\nassassination. Troops are deployed in West Beirut and its southern\nsuburbs, in Al Biqa, and in northern Lebanon. Iran also maintains\na small contingent of revolutionary guards in Al Biqa, from\nwhich it supports Lebanese Islamic fundamentalist groups.\n\n   Israel withdrew the bulk of its forces from the south in 1985,\nalthough it still retains troops in a 10-km-deep security zone north\nof its border with Lebanon. Israel arms and trains the Army of South\nLebanon (ASL), which also occupies the security zone and is Israel's\nfirst line of defense against attacks on its northern border.\n\n   The following description is based on the present constitutional and\ncustomary practices of the Lebanese system.\n\nLong-form name: Republic of Lebanon; note--may be changed to\nLebanese Republic\n\nType: republic\n\nCapital: Beirut\n\nAdministrative divisions: 5 governorates (muhafazat,\nsingular--muhafazah); Al Biqa, Al Janub, Ash Shamal,\nBayrut, Jabal Lubnan\n\nIndependence: 22 November 1943 (from League of Nations mandate under\nFrench administration)\n\nConstitution: 26 May 1926 (amended)\n\nLegal system: mixture of Ottoman law, canon law, Napoleonic code,\nand civil law; no judicial review of legislative acts; has not accepted\ncompulsory ICJ jurisdiction\n\nNational holiday: Independence Day, 22 November (1943)\n\nExecutive branch: president, prime minister, Cabinet; note--by custom,\nthe president is a Maronite Christian, the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim,\nand the president of the legislature is a Shia Muslim\n\nLegislative branch: unicameral National Assembly (Arabic--Majlis\nAlnuwab, French--Assemblee Nationale)\n\nJudicial branch: four Courts of Cassation (three courts for civil and\ncommercial cases and one court for criminal cases)\n\nLeaders:\nChief of State--Elias HARAWI (since 24 November 1989);\n\nHead of Government--Prime Minister Salim AL-HUSS (since 24\nNovember 1989)\n\nPolitical parties and leaders: political party activity is organized along\nlargely sectarian lines; numerous political groupings exist, consisting of\nindividual political figures and followers motivated by religious, clan, and\neconomic considerations; most parties have well-armed militias, which are still\ninvolved in occasional clashes\n\nSuffrage: compulsory for all males at age 21; authorized for women\nat age 21 with elementary education\n\nElections:\nNational Assembly--elections should be held every four years\nbut security conditions have prevented elections since May 1972\n\nCommunists: the Lebanese Communist Party was legalized in 1970; members\nand sympathizers estimated at 2,000-3,000\n\nMember of: Arab League, CCC, FAO, G-77, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, IDA,\nIDB--Islamic Development Bank, IFAD, IFC, ILO, IMF, IMO, INTELSAT, INTERPOL,\nIPU, ITU, IWC--International Wheat Council, NAM, OIC, UN, UNESCO, UPU, WFTU,\nWHO, WMO, WSG, WTO\n\nDiplomatic representation: Ambassador (vacant); Charge\nd'Affaires Suleiman RASSI; note--the former Lebanese Ambassador,\nDr. Abdallah Bouhabib, is loyal to Gen.

The ordinary Lebanese citizen\nstruggles to keep afloat in an environment of physical danger, high\nunemployment, and growing shortages. The central government's ability\nto collect taxes has suffered greatly from militia control and taxation\nof local areas. As the civil strife persists, the US dollar has become\nmore and more the medium of exchange. Transportation,\ncommunications, and other parts of the infrastructure continue to deteriorate.\nFamily remittances, foreign political money going to the factions, international\nemergency aid, and a small volume of manufactured exports help prop up the\nbattered economy.

Since 1980, however, the sharp drop in oil prices and resulting\ndecline in export revenues has adversely affected economic development. In 1986\nper capita GNP was the highest in Africa at $5,410, but it had been $2,000\nhigher in 1982. Severe cutbacks in imports over the past five years have\nled to shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs, although the reopening\nof the Libyan-Tunisian border in April 1988 and the Libyan-Egyptian\nborder in December 1989 have somewhat eased shortages. Austerity\nbudgets and a lack of trained technicians have undermined the government's\nability to implement a number of planned infrastructure development\nprojects. The nonoil industrial and construction sectors, which\naccount for about 15% of GNP, have expanded from processing\nmostly agricultural products to include petrochemicals, iron, steel,\nand aluminum. Although agriculture accounts for less than 5% of GNP, it employs\n20% of the labor force. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit farm\noutput, requiring Libya to import about 75% of its food requirements.\n\nGNP: $20 billion, per capita $5,410; real growth rate 0% (1988 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 20% (1988 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: 2% (1988 est.)\n\nBudget: revenues $6.4 billion;

The sale of postage stamps to collectors is estimated at $10\nmillion annually and accounts for 10% of revenues. Low business taxes (the\nmaximum tax rate is 20%) and easy incorporation rules have induced about 25,000\nholding or so-called letter box companies to establish nominal offices in\nLiechtenstein.

Real output grew by 8.7% in 1988 and\nabout 7.7% in 1989, helped by vigorous growth in manufacturing output and\nfurther increases in foreign direct investment, particularly from\nJapanese and Taiwanese firms facing higher costs at home. Malaysia has\nbecome the world's third-largest producer of semiconductor devices\n(after the US and Japan) and the world's largest exporter of semiconductor\ndevices. Inflation remained low as unemployment stood at about 8% of\nthe labor force and as the government followed prudent fiscal/monetary\npolicies. The country is not self-sufficient in food, and a majority\nof the rural population subsists at the poverty level.

Agriculture accounts for about 7% of GDP and the small industrial\nsector for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with most of the sugarcane now\nused for the production of rum. Banana exports are increasing, however, going\nmostly to France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be\nimported, contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual\ntransfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than\nagricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the work\nforce is employed in the service sector and in administration. In 1984 the\nannual per capita income was relatively high at $3,650. During 1985 the\nunemployment rate was between 25% and 30% and was particularly severe among\nyounger workers.\n\nGDP: $1.3 billion, per capita $3,650; real growth rate NA% (1984)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3.4% (1986)\n\nUnemployment rate: 25-30% (1985)\n\nBudget: revenues $223 million;

Real growth averaged 4% in the\n1980s until FY89, when it plunged to 1.5% because of the ongoing\ntrade/transit dispute with India. Agriculture is the mainstay of the\neconomy, providing a livelihood for over 90% of the population and\naccounting for 60% of GDP and about 75% of exports. Industrial activity is\nlimited, and what there is involves the processing of agricultural\nproduce (jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain).\nApart from agricultural land and forests, the only other exploitable natural\nresources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Despite considerable investment in\nthe agricultural sector, production in the 1980s has not kept pace with the\npopulation growth of 2.7%, which has led to a reduction in exportable surpluses\nand balance-of-payments difficulties. Economic prospects for the 1990s\nremain grim.\n\nGDP: $2.9 billion, per capita $158; real growth rate 1.5% (FY89)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 8.1% (FY89 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: 5%; underemployment estimated at 25-40% (1987)\n\nBudget: revenues $296 million;

The islands enjoy a comparatively high per\ncapita income and a well-developed infrastructure compared with other\ncountries in the region. Unlike many Latin American countries, the\nNetherlands Antilles has avoided large international debt. Almost all\nconsumer and capital goods are imported, with the US being the major\nsupplier. The economy has suffered somewhat in recent years because\nof the depressed state of the world oil market and declining tax revenues.\nIn 1983 the drop in oil prices led to the devaluation of the Venezuelan\nbolivar, which ended a substantial flow of Venezuelan tourists to the\nislands. As a result of a decline in tax revenues, the government has\nbeen seeking financial support from the Netherlands.\n\nGDP: $1.0 billion, per capita $5,500; real growth rate 3% (1988 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.0% (1988)\n\nUnemployment rate: 26.0% (1988)\n\nBudget: revenues $180 million;

Over 50% of the agricultural and industrial\nfirms are state owned. Sandinista economic policies and the war have\nproduced a severe economic crisis. The foundation of the economy\ncontinues to be the export of agricultural commodities, largely coffee\nand cotton. Farm production fell by roughly 7% in 1989, the fifth\nsuccessive year of decline. The agricultural sector employs 44%\nof the work force and accounts for 23% of GDP and 86% of export earnings.\nIndustry, which employs 13% of the work force and contributes 26% to GDP,\nshowed a sharp drop of - 23% in 1988 and remains below pre-1979 levels.\nExternal debt is one of the highest in the world on a per capita basis.\nIn 1989 the annual inflation rate was 1,700%, down from a record\n16,000% in 1988.

The government is the major employer of the work force, relying\nheavily on financial assistance from the US.\n\nGDP: $31.6 million, per capita $2,260; real growth rate NA% (1986)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\n\nUnemployment rate: 20% (1986)\n\nBudget: revenues $6.0 million; expenditures NA, including capital\nexpenditures of NA (1986)\n\nExports: $0.5 million (f.o.b., 1986); commodities--NA;\npartners--US, Japan\n\nImports: $27.2 million (c.i.f., 1986); commodities--NA;\npartners--US\n\nExternal debt: $NA\n\nIndustrial production: growth rate NA%\n\nElectricity: 16,000 kW capacity; 22 million kWh produced,\n1,550 kWh per capita (1989)\n\nIndustries: tourism, craft items (shell, wood, pearl), some commercial\nfishing and agriculture\n\nAgriculture: subsistence-level production of coconut, copra, cassava,\nsweet potatoes\n\nAid: US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-87), $2 billion;\nWestern (non-US) countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-87),\n$62.6 million\n\nCurrency: US currency is used\n\nExchange rates: US currency is used\n\nFiscal year: 1 October-30 September\n\n- Communications\nHighways: 25.7 km paved macadam and concrete roads, otherwise\nstone-, coral-, or laterite-surfaced roads (1986)\n\nPorts: Koror\n\nAirports: 2 with permanent-surface runways 1,220-2,439 m\n\nTelecommunications: stations--1 AM, 1 FM, 1 TV; 1 Pacific Ocean INTELSAT\nearth station\n\n- Defense Forces\nNote: defense is the responsibility of the US and that will not\nchange when the UN trusteeship terminates\n----------------------------------------------------\nCountry:  Pacific Ocean\n- Geography\nTotal area: 165,384,000 km2; includes Arafura Sea, Banda Sea,\nBellingshausen Sea, Bering Sea, Bering Strait, Coral Sea, East China Sea,\nGulf of Alaska, Makassar Strait, Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Sea of Japan,\nSea of Okhotsk, South China Sea, Tasman Sea, and other tributary water bodies\n\nComparative area: slightly less than 18 times the size of the US;\nthe largest ocean (followed by the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Arctic\nOcean); covers about one-third of the global surface; larger than the total\nland area of the world\n\nCoastline: 135,663 km\n\nClimate: the western Pacific is monsoonal--a rainy season occurs during\nthe summer months, when moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean over the\nland, and a dry season during the winter months, when dry winds blow from\nthe Asian land mass back to the ocean\n\nTerrain: surface in the northern Pacific dominated by a clockwise, warm\nwater gyre (broad, circular system of currents) and in the southern Pacific by\na counterclockwise, cool water gyre; sea ice occurs in the Bering Sea and\nSea of Okhotsk during winter and reaches maximum northern extent from\nAntarctica in October; the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is dominated by\nthe East Pacific Rise, while the western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches;\nthe world's greatest depth is 10,924 meters in the Marianas Trench\n\nNatural resources: oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and\ngravel aggregates, placer deposits, fish\n\nEnvironment: endangered marine species include the dugong, sea lion,\nsea otter, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution in Philippine Sea and\nSouth China Sea; dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in\nthe southwestern Pacific Ocean; subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in\nsoutheast and east Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to\nOctober); tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike\nCentral America and Mexico from June to October (most common in August and\nSeptember); southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from Antarctica;\noccasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru when the trade\nwinds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent moves south, which\nkills the plankton that is the primary food source for anchovies;\nconsequently, the anchovies move to better feeding grounds, causing resident\nmarine birds to starve by the thousands because of their lost food source\n\nNote: the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal,\nLuzon Strait, and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the Pacific Ocean\ninto the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean; ships subject to\nsuperstructure icing in extreme north from October to May and in extreme south\nfrom May to October; persistent fog in the northern Pacific from June to\nDecember is a hazard to shipping; surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic\nand earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring of Fire\n\n- Economy\nOverview: The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world\neconomy and particularly to those nations its waters directly touch.\nIt provides cheap sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing\ngrounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel for the\nconstruction industry. In 1985 over half (54%) of the world's total fish catch\ncame from the Pacific Ocean, which is the only ocean where the fish catch\nhas increased every year since 1978. Exploitation of offshore oil and gas\nreserves is playing an ever increasing role in the energy supplies of Australia,\nNew Zealand, China, US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering offshore oil\nand gas, combined with the lower world prices for oil since 1985, has slowed\nbut not stopped new drillings.\n\nIndustries: fishing, oil and gas production\n\n- Communications\nPorts: Bangkok (Thailand), Hong Kong, Los Angeles (US),\nManila (Philippines), Pusan (South Korea), San Francisco (US), Seattle (US),\nShanghai (China), Singapore, Sydney (Australia), Vladivostok (USSR),\nWellington (NZ), Yokohama (Japan)\n\nTelecommunications: several submarine cables with network focused\non Guam and Hawaii\n----------------------------------------------------\nCountry:  Pakistan\n- Geography\nTotal area: 803,940 km2;

In addition, the economy must support a\nlarge military establishment and provide for the needs of 4 million Afghan\nrefugees. A real economic growth rate averaging 5-6% in recent years has enabled\nthe country to cope with these problems. Almost all agriculture and small-scale\nindustry is in private hands, and the government seeks to privatize a portion\nof the large-scale industrial enterprises now publicly owned. In\nDecember 1988, Pakistan signed a three-year economic reform agreement\nwith the IMF, which provides for a reduction in the government deficit\nand a liberalization of trade in return for further IMF financial\nsupport. The so-called Islamization of the economy has affected mainly the\nfinancial sector; for example, a prohibition on certain types of interest\npayments. Pakistan almost certainly will make little headway against its\npopulation problem; at the current rate of growth, population would\ndouble in 32 years.\n\nGNP: $43.2 billion, per capita $409; real growth rate 5.1% (FY89)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 11% (FY89)\n\nUnemployment rate: 4% (FY89 est.)\n\nBudget: revenues $7.5 billion;

Agriculture,\nincluding forestry, accounts for about 25% of GNP, employs about 45% of\nthe labor force, and provides the bulk of exports. Paraguay has no known\nsignificant mineral or petroleum resources, but does have a large\nhydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined\ncompared with the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an\naverage annual rate of nearly 11%.  During 1982-86 real GDP fell three\nout of five years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and\nforeign debt rose. Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the\neconomy were the completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather\nfor crops, and weak international commodity prices for agricultural exports.\nIn 1987 the economy experienced a modest recovery because of improved weather\nconditions and stronger international prices for key agricultural exports. The\nrecovery continued through 1988, with a bumper soybean crop and record cotton\nproduction. The government, however, must follow through on promises of reforms\nneeded to deal with large fiscal deficits, growing debt arrearages,\nand falling reserves.\n\nGDP: $8.9 billion, per capita $1,970;

About 75% of agricultural production had come from the\nprivate sector and the rest from state farms. The economy has presented a\npicture of moderate but slowing growth against a background of underlying\nweaknesses in technology and worker motivation. GNP increased between 3%\nand 6% annually during the period 1983-1986, but grew only 2.5% and 2.1%\nin 1987 and 1988, respectively. Output dropped by 1.5% in 1989. The\ninflation rate, after falling sharply from the 1982 peak of 100% to 22%\nin 1986, rose to a galloping rate of 640% in 1989. Shortages of consumer\ngoods and some food items worsened in 1988-89. Agricultural products and\ncoal have remained the biggest hard currency earners, but manufactures\nare increasing in importance. Poland, with its hard currency debt of\napproximately $40 billion, is severely limited in its ability to import\nmuch-needed hard currency goods. The sweeping political changes of 1989\ndisrupted normal economic channels and exacerbated shortages. In January\n1990, the new Solidarity-led government adopted a cold turkey program for\ntransforming Poland to a market economy. The government moved to\neliminate subsidies, end artificially low prices, make the zloty\nconvertible, and, in general, halt the hyperinflation. These financial\nmeasures are accompanied by plans to privatize the economy in stages.\nSubstantial outside aid will be needed if Poland is to make a successful\ntransition in the 1990s.\n\nGNP: $172.4 billion, per capita $4,565;

In recent years the agricultural sector\nhas had to contend with drought, mismanagement, and shortages of inputs.\nFavorable weather in 1989 helped produce a good harvest, although far\nbelow government claims. The new government is slowly loosening the tight\ncentral controls of Ceausescu's command economy. It has instituted\nmoderate land reforms, with close to one-third of cropland now in\nprivate hands, and it has allowed changes in prices for private\nagricultural output. Also, the new regime is permitting the\nestablishment of private enterprises of 20 or fewer employees in\nservices, handicrafts, and small-scale industry. Furthermore, the\ngovernment has halted the old policy of diverting food from domestic\nconsumption to hard currency export markets. So far, the government\ndoes not seem willing to adopt a thorough-going market system.\n\nGNP: $79.8 billion, per capita $3,445; real growth rate - 1.5%\n(1989 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 0% (1987)\n\nUnemployment rate: NA%\n\nBudget:  revenues $26 billion;

There is also an expanding industrial base supported by\nforeign investment in manufacturing and other activities, such as in data\nprocessing. The economy, however, remains vulnerable because the important\nagricultural sector is dominated by banana production. St. Lucia is subject\nto periodic droughts and/or tropical storms, and its protected market agreement\nwith the UK for bananas may end in 1992.\n\nGDP: $172 million, per capita $1,258; real growth rate 6.8% (1988\nest.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 7.0% (1987)\n\nUnemployment rate: 18.6% (1986)\n\nBudget: revenues $71.7 million;

The economy has been declining, however, because the number\nof ships stopping at St. Pierre has steadily dropped over the years. In\nMarch 1989, an agreement between France and Canada set fish quotas for\nSt. Pierre's trawlers fishing in Canadian and Canadian-claimed waters for\nthree years. The agreement settles a longstanding dispute that had\nvirtually brought fish exports to a halt. The islands are heavily\nsubsidized by France.

Since then, however, cocoa\nproduction has gradually deteriorated because of drought and\nmismanagement, so that by 1987 output had fallen to less than 50% of\nits former levels. As a result, a shortage of cocoa for export has\ncreated a serious balance-of-payments problem. Production of less\nimportant crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm kernels, has\nalso declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of\nexports by a ratio of 4 to 1. The emphasis on cocoa production at\nthe expense of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import\n90% of food needs. It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured\ngoods. Over the years, Sao Tome has been unable to service its external\ndebt, which amounts to roughly 80% of export earnings. Considerable\npotential exists for development of a tourist industry, and the\ngovernment has taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The\ngovernment also implemented a Five-Year Plan covering 1986-90 to\nrestructure the economy and reschedule external debt service payments in\ncooperation with the International Development Association and Western\nlenders.\n\nGDP: $37.9 million, per capita $340;

In contrast, most of the\nremaining population suffers from the poverty patterns of the Third\nWorld, including unemployment, lack of job skills, and barriers to\nmovement into higher-paying fields. Inputs and outputs thus do not move\nsmoothly into the most productive employments, and the effectiveness\nof the market is further lowered by international constraints on\ndealings with South Africa. The main strength of the economy lies in\nits rich mineral resources, which provide two-thirds of exports.\nAverage growth of 2% in output in recent years falls far short of the\nlevel needed to cut into the high unemployment level.\n\nGDP: $83.5 billion, per capita $2,380;

The initial reforms featured greater authority for\nenterprise managers over prices, wages, product mix, investment, sources\nof supply, and customers. But in the absence of effective market\ndiscipline, the result was the disappearance of low-price goods,\nexcessive wage increases, an even larger volume of unfinished\nconstruction projects, and, in general, continued economic stagnation.\nThe Gorbachev regime has made at least four serious errors in economic\npolicy in these five years: the unpopular and short-lived anti-alcohol\ncampaign; the initial cutback in imports of consumer goods; the failure\nto act decisively for the privatization of agriculture; and the buildup\nof a massive overhang of unspent rubles in the hands of households and\nenterprises. In October 1989, a top economic adviser, Leonid Abalkin\npresented an ambitious but reasonable timetable for the conversion to a\npartially privatized market system in the 1990s. In December 1989,\nhowever, Premier Ryzhkov's conservative approach prevailed, namely, the\ncontention that a period of retrenchment was necessary to provide a\nstable financial and legislative base for launching further reforms.\nAccordingly, the new strategy was to put the reform process on hold in\n1990-92 by recentralizing economic authority and to placate the\nrank-and-file through sharp increases in consumer goods output. In still\nanother policy twist, the leadership in early 1990 was considering a\nmarked speedup in the marketization process. Because the economy is\ncaught in between two systems, there was in 1989 an even greater mismatch\nbetween what was produced and what would serve the best interests of\nenterprises and households. Meanwhile, the seething nationality problems\nhave been dislocating regional patterns of economic specialization and\npose a further major threat to growth prospects over the next few years.\n\nGNP: $2,659.5 billion, per capita $9,211;

The economy is dominated\nby governmental entities that account for more than 70% of new\ninvestment. The private sector's main areas of activity are agriculture\nand trading, with most private industrial investment predating 1980. The\neconomy's base is agriculture, which employs 80% of the work force.\nIndustry mainly processes agricultural items. A high foreign debt and\narrearages of about $13 billion continue to cause difficulties. Since\n1979 the International Monetary Fund has provided assistance and has\nforced Sudan to make economic reforms aimed at improving the\nperformance of the economy.\n\nGDP: $8.5 billion, per capita $340 (FY87);

The\neconomy has been in trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in\n1982. A drop in world bauxite prices that started in the late 1970s and\ncontinued until late 1986, was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla\ninsurgency in the interior. The guerrillas targeted the economic\ninfrastructure, crippling the important bauxite sector and shutting down\nother export industries. These problems have created both high inflation\nand high unemployment. A small gain in economic growth of 3.6% was\nregistered in 1988 due to reduced guerrilla activity and improved\ninternational markets for bauxite.\n\nGDP: $1.27 billion, per capita $3,215; real growth rate 3.6%\n(1988 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 50% (1988 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: 27% (1988)\n\nBudget: revenues $466 million;

It has essentially full employment,\na modern distribution system, excellent internal and external\ncommunications, and a skilled and intelligent labor force. Timber,\nhydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy\nthat is heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms\naccount for about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering\nsector accounts for 50% of output and exports.

Per capita output, general living standards, education\nand science, health care, and diet are unsurpassed in Europe. Inflation\nremains low because of sound government policy and harmonious\nlabor-management relations. Unemployment is negligible, a marked\ncontrast to the larger economies of Western Europe. This economic\nstability helps promote the important banking and tourist sectors. Since\nWorld War II, Switzerland's economy has adjusted smoothly to the great\nchanges in output and trade patterns in Europe and presumably can adjust\nto the challenges of the 1990s, in particular, the further economic\nintegration of Western Europe and the amazingly rapid changes in East\nEuropean political/economic prospects.\n\nGDP: $119.5 billion, per capita $17,800;

Economic difficulties are attributable, in part, to severe\ndrought in several recent years, costly but unsuccessful attempts to match\nIsrael's military strength, a falloff in Arab aid, and insufficient foreign\nexchange earnings to buy needed inputs for industry and agriculture. Socialist\npolicy, embodied in a thicket of bureaucratic regulations, in many instances\nhas driven away or pushed underground the mercantile and entrepreneurial spirit\nfor which Syrian businessmen have long been famous. Two bright spots: a sizable\nnumber of villagers have benefited from land redistribution, electrification,\nand other rural development programs; and a recent find of light crude oil\nhas enabled Syria to cut back its substantial imports of light crude. A\nlong-term concern is the additional drain of upstream Euphrates water by\nTurkey when its vast dam and irrigation projects are completed toward the end\nof the 1990s.\n\nGDP: $18.5 billion, per capita $1,540;

The trade deficit\nof $5.2 billion was more than offset by earnings from tourism\n($3.9 billion), remittances, and net capital inflows. The government has\nfollowed a fairly sound fiscal and monetary policy, aided by increased\ntax receipts from the fast-moving economy.

During the first half of the 1980s, the petroleum sector\naccounted for nearly 80% of export earnings, 40% of government revenues,\nand almost 25% of GDP. In recent years, however, the economy has suffered\nbecause of the sharp fall in the price of oil. The government, in response to\nthe revenue loss, pursued a series of austerity measures that pushed the\nunemployment rate to 22% in 1988. Agriculture employs only about 11% of\nthe labor force and produces less than 3% of GDP. Since this sector is small, it\nhas been unable to absorb the large numbers of the unemployed. The\ngovernment currently seeks to diversify its export base.\n\nGDP: $3.75 billion, per capita $3,070; real growth rate - 2.0% (1988 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 15.0% (1989 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: 22% (1988)\n\nBudget: revenues $1.4 billion;

Two successive drought-induced crop\nfailures have strained the government's budget and increased\nunemployment.  The current account fell from a $23 million surplus in\n1988 to a $390 million deficit in 1989. Despite its foreign payments\nproblems, Tunis appears committed to its IMF-supported structural\nadjustment program. Nonetheless, the government may have to slow its\nimplementation to head off labor unrest.  The increasing foreign\ndebt--$7.6 billion at yearend 1989--is also a key problem. Tunis\nprobably will seek debt relief in 1990.\n\nGDP: $8.7 billion, per capita $1,105; real growth rate 3.1% (1989 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 10% (1989)\n\nUnemployment rate: 25% (1989)\n\nBudget: revenues $2.9 billion;

The economy has grown steadily since\nthe early 1980s, with real growth in per capita GDP increasing more than 6%\nannually. Agriculture remains the most important economic sector,\nemploying about 60% of the labor force, accounting for almost 20% of GDP, and\ncontributing about 25% to exports. Impressive growth in recent years has not\nsolved all of the economic problems facing Turkey. Inflation and interest rates\nremain high, and a large budget deficit will continue to provide difficulties\nfor a country undergoing a substantial transformation from a centrally\ncontrolled to a free market economy. The government has launched a\nmultimillion-dollar development program in the southeastern region, which\nincludes the building of a dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to\ngenerate electric power and irrigate large tracts of farmland.

Coffee is the major export crop and accounted for 97% of export\nrevenues in 1988. Since 1986 the government has acted to rehabilitate and\nstabilize the economy by undertaking currency reform, raising producer\nprices on export crops, increasing petroleum prices, and\nimproving civil service wages.

The economy is essentially capitalistic with a generous admixture\nof social welfare programs and government ownership. Over the last decade\nthe Thatcher government has halted the expansion of welfare measures and\nhas promoted extensive reprivatization of the government economic sector.\nAgriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European\nstandards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor\nforce. Industry is a mixture of public and private enterprises, employing\nabout 24% of the work force and generating 22% of GDP. The UK is an\nenergy-rich nation with large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves;\nprimary energy production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest\nshares of any industrial nation. Following the recession of 1979-81, the\neconomy has enjoyed the longest period of continuous economic growth it\nhas had during the last 30 years. During the period 1982-89 real GDP grew\nby about 25%, while the inflation rate of 14% was nearly halved. Between\n1986 and 1989 unemployment fell from 11% to about 6%. As a major trading\nnation, the UK will continue to be greatly affected by: world boom or\nrecession; swings in the international oil market; productivity trends in\ndomestic industry; and the terms on which the economic integration of\nEurope proceeds.\n\nGDP: $818.0 billion, per capita $14,300;

Raising livestock,\nparticularly cattle and sheep, is the major agricultural activity. In\n1988, despite healthy exports and an improved current account, domestic\ngrowth slowed because of government concentration on the external sector,\nadverse weather conditions, and prolonged strikes. High inflation rates\nof about 80%, a large domestic debt, and frequent strikes remain major economic\nproblems for the government.\n\nGDP: $8.8 billion, per capita $2,950; real growth rate 1% (1989 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 80% (1989 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: 9.0% (1989 est.)\n\nBudget: revenues $1.2 billion;

Rice is the staple crop;\nsubstantial amounts of maize, sorghum, cassava, and sweet potatoes are\nalso grown. The government permits sale of surplus grain on the open\nmarket. Most of the mineral resources are located in the north,\nincluding coal, which is an important export item. Following the\nend of the war in 1975, heavy handed government measures undermined\nefforts at an efficient merger of the agricultural resources of the\nsouth and the industrial resources of the north. The economy remains\nheavily dependent on foreign aid and has received assistance from\nCommunist countries, Sweden, and UN agencies. Inflation, although down\nfrom recent triple-digit levels, is still a major weakness, and per\ncapita output is among the world's lowest. Since early 1989 the\ngovernment has sponsored a broad reform program that seeks to turn more\neconomic activity over to the private sector.\n\nGNP: $14.2 billion, per capita $215; real growth rate 8% (1989 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 40% (1989 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: 25% (1989 est.)\n\nBudget: revenues $3.2 billion;

As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by President\nReagan's 1 September 1982 peace initiative, the final status of the West\nBank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a peace\ntreaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the concerned\nparties.  Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will resolve the\nrespective boundaries.  Pending the completion of this process, it is US policy\nthat the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be\ndetermined.  In the view of the US, the term West Bank describes all of the\narea west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before the 1967\nArab-Israeli war.  However, with respect to negotiations envisaged in the\nframework agreement, it is US policy that a distinction must be made between\nJerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the city's special status\nand circumstances.  Therefore, a negotiated solution for the final status of\nJerusalem could be different in character from that of the rest of the West\nBank.\n\n- Geography\nTotal area: 5,860 km2; land area: 5,640 km2; includes West Bank,\nEast Jerusalem, Latrun Salient, Jerusalem No Man's Land, and the northwest\nquarter of the Dead Sea, but excludes Mt.

It is US policy that the final status of the\nWest Bank will be determined by negotiations among the concerned parties.\nThese negotiations will determine how the area is to be governed.\n\n- Economy\nOverview: Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by Israeli\nmilitary occupation and the effects of the Palestinian uprising. Industries\nusing advanced technology or requiring sizable financial resources have been\ndiscouraged by a lack of financial resources and Israeli policy. Capital\ninvestment has largely gone into residential housing, not into productive assets\nthat could compete with Israeli industry. A major share of GNP is derived from\nremittances of workers employed in Israel and neighboring Gulf states. Israeli\nreprisals against Palestinian unrest in the West Bank since 1987 have pushed\nunemployment up and lowered living standards.\n\nGNP: $1.0 billion, per capita $1,000; real growth rate - 15% (1988\nest.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\n\nUnemployment rate: NA%\n\nBudget: revenues $47.4 million; expenditures $45.7 million,\nincluding capital expenditures of NA (FY86)\n\nExports: $150 million (f.o.b., 1988 est.); commodities--NA;\npartners--Jordan, Israel\n\nImports: $410 million (c.i.f., 1988 est.); commodities--NA;\npartners--Jordan, Israel\n\nExternal debt: $NA\n\nIndustrial production: growth rate NA%\n\nElectricity: power supplied by Israel\n\nIndustries: generally small family businesses that produce cement,\ntextiles, soap, olive-wood carvings, and mother-of-pearl souvenirs; the Israelis\nhave established some small-scale modern industries in the settlements and\nindustrial centers\n\nAgriculture: olives, citrus and other fruits, vegetables, beef,\nand dairy products\n\nAid: none\n\nCurrency: new Israeli shekel (plural--shekels) and Jordanian dinar\n(plural--dinars); 1 new Israeli shekel (NIS) = 100 new agorot and 1 Jordanian\ndinar (JD) = 1,000 fils\n\nExchange rates: new Israeli shekels (NIS) per US$1--1.9450 (January\n1990), 1.9164 (1989), 1.5992 (1988), 1.5946 (1987), 1.4878 (1986), 1.1788\n(1985); Jordanian dinars (JD) per US$1--0.6557 (January 1990), 0.5704 (1989),\n0.3715 (1988), 0.3387 (1987), 0.3499 (1986), 0.3940 (1985)\n\nFiscal year: 1 April-31 March\n\n- Communications\nHighways: small indigenous road network, Israelis developing east-west\naxial highways\n\nAirports: 2 total, 2 usable; 2 with permanent-surface runways;\nnone with runways over 2,439 m; 1 with runways 1,220-2,439 m\n\nTelecommunications: open-wire telephone system currently being upgraded;\nstations--no AM, no FM, no TV\n\n- Defense Forces\nBranches: NA\n\nMilitary manpower: NA\n\nDefense expenditures: NA\n----------------------------------------------------\nCountry:  Western Sahara\n- Geography\nTotal area: 266,000 km2; land area: 266,000 km2\n\nComparative area: slightly smaller than Colorado\n\nLand boundaries: 2,046 km total; Algeria 42 km, Mauritania 1,561 km,\nMorocco 443 km\n\nCoastline: 1,110 km\n\nMaritime claims: contingent upon resolution of sovereignty issue\n\nDisputes: claimed and administered by Morocco, but sovereignty is\nunresolved and guerrilla fighting continues in the area\n\nClimate: hot, dry desert; rain is rare; cold offshore currents\nproduce fog and heavy dew\n\nTerrain: mostly low, flat desert with large areas of rocky or\nsandy surfaces rising to small mountains in south and northeast\n\nNatural resources: phosphates, iron ore\n\nLand use: NEGL% arable land; 0% permanent crops; 19% meadows and pastures;\n0% forest and woodland; 81% other\n\nEnvironment: hot, dry, dust/sand-laden sirocco wind can occur during\nwinter and spring; widespread harmattan haze exists 60% of time, often severely\nrestricting visibility; sparse water and arable land\n\n- People\nPopulation: 191,707 (July 1990), growth rate 2.7% (1990)\n\nBirth rate: 48 births/1,000 population (1990)\n\nDeath rate: 23 deaths/1,000 population (1990)\n\nNet migration rate: 2 migrants/1,000 population (1990)\n\nInfant mortality rate: 177 deaths/1,000 live births (1990)\n\nLife expectancy at birth: 39 years male, 41 years female (1990)\n\nTotal fertility rate: 7.3 children born/woman (1990)\n\nNationality: noun--Saharan(s), Moroccan(s); adjective--Saharan, Moroccan\n\nEthnic divisions: Arab and Berber\n\nReligion: Muslim\n\nLanguage: Hassaniya Arabic, Moroccan Arabic\n\nLiteracy: 20% among Moroccans, 5% among Saharans (est.)\n\nLabor force: 12,000; 50% animal husbandry and subsistence farming\n\nOrganized labor: NA\n\n- Government\nLong-form name: none\n\nType: legal status of territory and question of sovereignty unresolved;\nterritory contested by Morocco and Polisario Front (Popular Front for the\nLiberation of the Saguia el Hamra and Rio de Oro); territory partitioned between\nMorocco and Mauritania in April 1976, with Morocco acquiring northern\ntwo-thirds; Mauritania, under pressure from Polisario guerrillas, abandoned all\nclaims to its portion in August 1979; Morocco moved to occupy that sector\nshortly thereafter and has since asserted administrative control; the\nPolisario's government in exile was seated as an OAU member in 1984; guerrilla\nactivities continue to the present\n\nCapital: none\n\nAdministrative divisions: none (under de facto control of Morocco)\n\nLeaders: none\n\nDiplomatic representation: none\n\n- Economy\nOverview: Western Sahara, a territory poor in natural resources\nand having little rainfall, has a per capita GDP of just a few hundred\ndollars.

The technologically advanced\nareas--North America, Japan, and Western Europe--together account for\n65% of the gross world product (GWP) of $20.3 trillion; these developed\nareas grew in the aggregate at 3.5%. In contrast, the Communist (Second\nWorld) countries typically grew at between 0% and 2%, accounting for 23% of GWP.\nExperience in the developing countries continued mixed, with the newly\nindustrializing countries generally maintaining their rapid growth, and many\nothers struggling with debt, inflation, and inadequate investment. The year\n1989 ended with remarkable political upheavals in the Communist\ncountries, which presumably will dislocate economic production still further.\nThe addition of nearly 100 million people a year to an already overcrowded\nglobe will exacerbate the problems of pollution, desertification,\nunderemployment, and poverty throughout the 1990s.\n\nGWP (gross world product): $20.3 trillion, per capita $3,870; real growth\nrate 3.0% (1989 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5%, developed countries; 100%,\ndeveloping countries with wide variations (1989 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: NA%\n\nExports: $2,694 billion (f.o.b., 1988); commodities--NA;\npartners--in value, about 70% of exports from industrial countries\n\nImports: $2,750 billion (c.i.f., 1988); commodities--NA;\npartners--in value, about 75% of imports by the industrial countries\n\nExternal debt: $1,008 billion for less developed countries (1988 est.)\n\nIndustrial production: growth rate 5% (1989 est.)\n\nElectricity: 2,838,680,000 kW capacity; 11,222,029 million kWh produced,\n2,140 kWh per capita (1989)\n\nIndustries: chemicals, energy, machinery, electronics, metals, mining,\ntextiles, food processing\n\nAgriculture: cereals (wheat, maize, rice), sugar, livestock products,\ntropical crops, fruit, vegetables, fish\n\nAid: NA\n\n- Communications\nPorts: Mina al Ahmadi (Kuwait), Chiba, Houston, Kawasaki, Kobe,\nMarseille, New Orleans, New York, Rotterdam, Yokohama\n\n- Defense Forces\nBranches: ground, maritime, and air forces at all levels of\ntechnology\n\nMilitary manpower: 29.15 million persons in the defense forces\nof the World (1987)\n\nDefense expenditures: 5.4% of GWP, or $1.1 trillion (1989 est.)\n----------------------------------------------------\nCountry:  Yemen Arab Republic\nYemen (Sanaa) or North Yemen\n- Geography\nTotal area: 195,000 km2; land area: 195,000 km2\n\nComparative area: slightly smaller than South Dakota\n\nLand boundaries: 1,209 km total; Saudi Arabia 628 km, PDRY 581 km\n\nCoastline: 523 km\n\nMaritime claims:\n\nContiguous zone: 18 nm;\n\nContinental shelf: 200 meters;\n\nTerritorial sea: 12 nm\n\nDisputes: sections of the boundary with PDRY are indefinite or\nundefined; undefined section of boundary with Saudi Arabia\n\nClimate: desert; hot and humid along coast; temperate in central\nmountains; harsh desert in east\n\nTerrain: narrow coastal plain (Tihama); western mountains; flat\ndissected plain in center sloping into desert interior of Arabian Peninsula\n\nNatural resources: crude oil, rock salt, marble; small deposits of coal,\nnickel, and copper; fertile soil\n\nLand use: 14% arable land; NEGL% permanent crops; 36% meadows and\npastures; 8% forest and woodland; 42% other; includes 1% irrigated\n\nEnvironment: subject to sand and dust storms in summer;\novergrazing; soil erosion; desertification\n\nNote: controls northern approaches to Bab el Mandeb linking Red Sea\nand Gulf of Aden, one of world's most active shipping lanes\n\n- People\nPopulation: 7,160,981 (July 1990), growth rate 3.1% (1990)\n\nBirth rate: 52 births/1,000 population (1990)\n\nDeath rate: 17 deaths/1,000 population (1990)\n\nNet migration rate: - 4 migrants/1,000 population (1990)\n\nInfant mortality rate: 129 deaths/1,000 live births (1990)\n\nLife expectancy at birth: 48 years male, 49 years female (1990)\n\nTotal fertility rate: 7.6 children born/woman (1990)\n\nNationality: noun--Yemeni(s); adjective--Yemeni\n\nEthnic divisions: 90% Arab, 10% Afro-Arab (mixed)\n\nReligion: 100% Muslim (Sunni and Shia)\n\nLanguage: Arabic\n\nLiteracy: 15% (est.)\n\nLabor force: NA; 70% agriculture and herding, 30% expatriate laborers\n(est.)\n\n- Government\nLong-form name: Yemen Arab Republic; abbreviated YAR\n\nType: republic; military regime assumed power in June 1974\n\nCapital: Sanaa\n\nAdministrative divisions: 11 governorates (muhafazat,\nsingular--muhafazah); Al Bayda, Al Hudaydah, Al Jawf,\nAl Mahwit, Dhamar, Hajjah, Ibb, Marib, Sadah, Sana,\nTaizz\n\nIndependence: November 1918 (from Ottoman Empire)\n\nConstitution: 28 December 1970, suspended 19 June 1974\n\nLegal system: based on Turkish law, Islamic law, and local customary law;\nhas not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction\n\nNational holiday: Proclamation of the Republic, 26 September (1962)\n\nExecutive branch: president, vice president, prime minister,\nfour deputy prime ministers, Council of Ministers (cabinet)\n\nLegislative branch: unicameral Consultative Assembly\n(Majlis ash-Shura)\n\nJudicial branch: State Security Court\n\nLeaders:\nChief of State--President Col.

A prominent feature of the reforms was the establishment\nof workers' self-management councils in all large plants, which were to\nselect managers, stimulate production, and divide the proceeds. The\ngeneral result of these reforms has been rampant wage-price inflation,\nsubstantial rundown of capital plant, consumer shortages, and a still\nlarger income gap between the poorer southern regions and the relatively\naffluent northern provinces of Hrvatska and Slovenija. In 1988-89 the\nbeleaguered central government has been reforming the reforms, trying\nto create an open market economy with still considerable state\nownership of major industrial plants. These reforms have been moving\nforward with the advice and support of the International Monetary Fund\nthrough a series of tough negotiations. Self-management supposedly is\nto be replaced by the discipline of the market and by fiscal austerity,\nultimately leading to a stable dinar. However, strikes in major plants,\nhyperinflation, and interregional political jousting have held back\nprogress. According to US economic advisers, only a highly unlikely\ncombination of genuine privatization, massive Western economic\ninvestment and aid, and political moderation can salvage this economy.\n\nGNP: $129.5 billion, per capita $5,464;

Agriculture,\na key sector of the economy, employs 75% of the population but generates\nunder 30% of GDP. The main impetus for economic development has been the\nextractive industries. Mining and mineral processing account for about\none-third of GDP and two-thirds of total export earnings. During the period\n1983-88 the economy experienced slow growth, high inflation, a rising foreign\ndebt, and a drop in foreign exchange earnings. Recent increases in foreign\nprices for copper--a key export earner--and other minerals offer some hope of\nreversing the economic decline.
