There has never\nbeen any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample\nevidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to\ntheir inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of\nhim who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches\nwhen I declare that “I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to\ninterfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it\nexists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no\ninclination to do so.” Those who nominated and elected me did so with\nfull knowledge that I had made this and many similar declarations, and\nhad never recanted them. And, more than this, they placed in the\nplatform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me, the\nclear and emphatic resolution which I now read:\n\n    “Resolved: that the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the\n    States, and especially the right of each State to order and control\n    its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment\n    exclusively, is essential to that balance of power on which the\n    perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend, and we\n    denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any\n    State or Territory, no matter under what pretext, as among the\n    gravest of crimes.”\n\nI now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon\nthe public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is\nsusceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section are\nto be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration. I add,\ntoo, that all the protection which, consistently with the Constitution\nand the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given to all the States\nwhen lawfully demanded, for whatever cause—as cheerfully to one section\nas to another.\n\nThere is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from\nservice or labor. The clause I now read is as plainly written in the\nConstitution as any other of its provisions:\n\n    “No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws\n    thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or\n    regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor, but\n    shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or\n    labor may be due.”\n\nIt is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who\nmade it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the\nintention of the lawgiver is the law. All members of Congress swear\ntheir support to the whole Constitution—to this provision as much as to\nany other. To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come\nwithin the terms of this clause “shall be delivered up”, their oaths\nare unanimous. Now, if they would make the effort in good temper, could\nthey not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of\nwhich to keep good that unanimous oath?\n\nThere is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be\nenforced by national or by State authority; but surely that difference\nis not a very material one. If the slave is to be surrendered, it can\nbe of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it\nis done. And should any one in any case be content that his oath shall\ngo unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to _how_ it shall be\nkept?\n\nAgain, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of\nliberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced,\nso that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave? And\nmight it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the\nenforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that\n“the citizen of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and\nimmunities of citizens in the several States?”\n\nI take the official oath today with no mental reservations, and with no\npurpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical\nrules. And while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of\nCongress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much\nsafer for all, both in official and private stations, to conform to and\nabide by all those acts which stand unrepealed, than to violate any of\nthem, trusting to find impunity in having them held to be\nunConstitutional.\n\nIt is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President\nunder our national Constitution. During that period fifteen different\nand greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered\nthe executive branch of the government. They have conducted it through\nmany perils, and generally with great success. Yet, with all this scope\nof precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief\nConstitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty.\nA disruption of the Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now\nformidably attempted.\n\nI hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution,\nthe Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not\nexpressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is\nsafe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its\norganic law for its own termination. Continue to execute all the\nexpress provisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will\nendure forever—it being impossible to destroy it except by some action\nnot provided for in the instrument itself.\n\nAgain, if the United States be not a government proper, but an\nassociation of States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a\ncontract, be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?\nOne party to a contract may violate it—break it, so to speak; but does\nit not require all to lawfully rescind it?\n\nDescending from these general principles, we find the proposition that\nin legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by the history\nof the Union itself. The Union is much older than the Constitution. It\nwas formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774. It was\nmatured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It\nwas further matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States\nexpressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the\nArticles of Confederation in 1778. And, finally, in 1787 one of the\ndeclared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution was\n“_to form a more perfect Union._”\n\nBut if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the\nStates be lawfully possible, the Union is _less_ perfect than before\nthe Constitution, having lost the vital element of perpetuity.\n\nIt follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion can\nlawfully get out of the Union; that Resolves and Ordinances to that\neffect are legally void; and that acts of violence, within any State or\nStates, against the authority of the United States, are insurrectionary\nor revolutionary, according to circumstances.\n\nI therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws,\nthe Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take\ncare, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the\nlaws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States. Doing this\nI deem to be only a simple duty on my part; and I shall perform it so\nfar as practicable, unless my rightful masters, the American people,\nshall withhold the requisite means, or in some authoritative manner\ndirect the contrary. I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but\nonly as the declared purpose of the Union that it _will_\nConstitutionally defend and maintain itself.\n\nIn doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there\nshall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority. The\npower confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the\nproperty and places belonging to the government, and to collect the\nduties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects,\nthere will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the\npeople anywhere. Where hostility to the United States, in any interior\nlocality, shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent\nresident citizens from holding the Federal offices, there will be no\nattempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object.\nWhile the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the\nexercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating,\nand so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better to forego for\nthe time the uses of such offices.\n\nThe mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts\nof the Union. So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that\nsense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and\nreflection. The course here indicated will be followed unless current\nevents and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,\nand in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised\naccording to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and a\nhope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the\nrestoration of fraternal sympathies and affections.\n\nThat there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy\nthe Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will\nneither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word\nto them. To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?\n\nBefore entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our\nnational fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes,\nwould it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it? Will you\nhazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any\nportion of the ills you fly from have no real existence? Will you,\nwhile the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones\nyou fly from—will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake?\n\nAll profess to be content in the Union if all Constitutional rights can\nbe maintained. Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written in the\nConstitution, has been denied? I think not. Happily the human mind is\nso constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this.\nThink, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written\nprovision of the Constitution has ever been denied. If by the mere\nforce of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly\nwritten Constitutional right, it might, in a moral point of view,\njustify revolution—certainly would if such a right were a vital one.\nBut such is not our case. All the vital rights of minorities and of\nindividuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and\nnegations, guaranties and prohibitions, in the Constitution, that\ncontroversies never arise concerning them. But no organic law can ever\nbe framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question\nwhich may occur in practical administration. No foresight can\nanticipate, nor any document of reasonable length contain, express\nprovisions for all possible questions. Shall fugitives from labor be\nsurrendered by national or State authority? The Constitution does not\nexpressly say. May Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories? The\nConstitution does not expressly say. _Must_ Congress protect slavery in\nthe Territories? The Constitution does not expressly say.\n\nFrom questions of this class spring all our constitutional\ncontroversies, and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.\nIf the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the\ngovernment must cease. There is no other alternative; for continuing\nthe government is acquiescence on one side or the other.\n\nIf a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce, they make\na precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them; for a minority of\ntheir own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be\ncontrolled by such minority. For instance, why may not any portion of a\nnew confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again, precisely\nas portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it? All who\ncherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper\nof doing this.\n\nIs there such perfect identity of interests among the States to compose\na new Union, as to produce harmony only, and prevent renewed secession?\n\nPlainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy. A\nmajority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations,\nand always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions\nand sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever\nrejects it does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism.\nUnanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent\narrangement, is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority\nprinciple, anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.\n\nI do not forget the position, assumed by some, that Constitutional\nquestions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I deny that\nsuch decisions must be binding, in any case, upon the parties to a\nsuit, as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled to\nvery high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other\ndepartments of the government. And while it is obviously possible that\nsuch decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect\nfollowing it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance\nthat it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases,\ncan better be borne than could the evils of a different practice. At\nthe same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of\nthe government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people, is to\nbe irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant\nthey are made, in ordinary litigation between parties in personal\nactions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to\nthat extent practically resigned their government into the hands of\nthat eminent tribunal. Nor is there in this view any assault upon the\ncourt or the judges. It is a duty from which they may not shrink to\ndecide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of theirs\nif others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.\n\nOne section of our country believes slavery is _right_, and ought to be\nextended, while the other believes it is _wrong_, and ought not to be\nextended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive-slave\nclause of the Constitution, and the law for the suppression of the\nforeign slave-trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can\never be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly\nsupports the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the dry\nlegal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I\nthink, cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases\n_after_ the separation of the sections than _before_. The foreign\nslave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived,\nwithout restriction, in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only\npartially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other.\n\nPhysically speaking, we cannot separate. We cannot remove our\nrespective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall\nbetween them. A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of the\npresence and beyond the reach of each other; but the different parts of\nour country cannot do this. They cannot but remain face to face, and\nintercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is\nit possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more\nsatisfactory after separation than before? Can aliens make treaties\neasier than friends can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully\nenforced between aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you go to\nwar, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides,\nan no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions\nas to terms of intercourse are again upon you.\n\nThis country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit\nit. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can\nexercise their _constitutional_ right of amending it, or their\n_revolutionary_ right to dismember or overthrow it. I cannot be\nignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are\ndesirous of having the national Constitution amended. While I make no\nrecommendation of amendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority\nof the people over the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the\nmodes prescribed in the instrument itself; and I should, under existing\ncircumstances, favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being\nafforded the people to act upon it. I will venture to add that to me\nthe convention mode seems preferable, in that it allows amendments to\noriginate with the people themselves, instead of only permitting them\nto take or reject propositions originated by others not especially\nchosen for the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they\nwould wish to either accept or refuse. I understand a proposed\namendment to the Constitution—which amendment, however, I have not\nseen—has passed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government\nshall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the States,\nincluding that of persons held to service. To avoid misconstruction of\nwhat I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular\namendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be\nimplied Constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made\nexpress and irrevocable.\n\nThe chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and\nthey have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of\nthe states. The people themselves can do this also if they choose; but\nthe executive, as such, has nothing to do with it. His duty is to\nadminister the present government, as it came to his hands, and to\ntransmit it, unimpaired by him, to his successor.\n\nWhy should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of\nthe people? Is there any better or equal hope in the world? In our\npresent differences is either party without faith of being in the\nright? If the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with his eternal truth and\njustice, be on your side of the North, or on yours of the South, that\ntruth and that justice will surely prevail, by the judgment of this\ngreat tribunal, the American people.\n\nBy the frame of the government under which we live, this same people\nhave wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief;\nand have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little to\ntheir own hands at very short intervals. While the people retain their\nvirtue and vigilance, no administration, by any extreme of wickedness\nor folly, can very seriously injure the government in the short space\nof four years.\n\nMy countrymen, one and all, think calmly and _well_ upon this whole\nsubject. Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time. If there be an\nobject to _hurry_ any of you in hot haste to a step which you would\nnever take _deliberately_, that object will be frustrated by taking\ntime; but no good object can be frustrated by it. Such of you as are\nnow dissatisfied, still have the old Constitution unimpaired, and, on\nthe sensitive point, the laws of your own framing under it; while the\nnew administration will have no immediate power, if it would, to change\neither. If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the\nright side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason for\nprecipitate action. Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm\nreliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land, are still\ncompetent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty.\n\nIn _your_ hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in _mine_,\nis the momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail\n_you_. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the\naggressors. _You_ have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the\ngovernment, while _I_ shall have the most solemn one to “preserve,\nprotect, and defend it.”\n\nI am loathe to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be\nenemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds\nof affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every\nbattlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all\nover this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again\ntouched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\n\n\n\n"}
