["﻿﻿*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JOHN F. KENNEDY'S INAUGURAL\r\nADDRESS ***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJFK's Inaugural Address, January 20, 1961, 12:11 EST\r\n\r\n\r\nWe observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom. . .\r\nsymbolizing an end as well as a beginning. . .signifying renewal\r\nas well as change for I have sworn before you and Almighty God\r\nthe same solemn oath our forbears prescribed nearly a century\r\nand three-quarters ago.\r\n\r\nThe world is very different now, for man holds in his mortal hands\r\nthe power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.\r\nAnd yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forbears fought\r\nare still at issue around the globe. . .the belief that the rights of man\r\ncome not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.\r\nWe dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution.\r\n\r\nLet the word go forth from this time and place. . .to friend and foe alike. . .\r\nthat the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans. . .\r\nborn in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace,\r\nproud of our ancient heritage. . .and unwilling to witness or permit the slow\r\nundoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed,\r\nand to which we are committed today. . .at home and around the world.\r\n\r\nLet every nation know. . .whether it wishes us well or ill. . .\r\nthat we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship,\r\nsupport any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and\r\nthe success of liberty.  This much we pledge. . .and more.\r\n\r\nTo those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share:\r\nwe pledge the loyalty of faithful friends.  United. . .there is\r\nlittle we cannot do in a host of co-operative ventures.\r\nDivided. . .there is little we can do. . .for we dare not meet\r\na powerful challenge, at odds, and split asunder.\r\nTo those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free:\r\nwe pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not\r\nhave passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny.\r\nWe shall not always expect to find them supporting our view.\r\nBut we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their\r\nown freedom. . .and to remember that. . .in the past. . .those who\r\nfoolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.\r\nTo those people in the huts and villages of half the globe\r\nstruggling to break the bonds of mass misery:  we pledge our best\r\nefforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period\r\nis required. . .not because the Communists may be doing it,\r\nnot because we seek their votes, but because it is right.\r\nIf a free society cannot help the many who are poor,\r\nit cannot save the few who are rich.\r\n\r\nTo our sister republics south of our border:  we offer a special pledge. . .\r\nto convert our good words into good deeds. . .in a new alliance for progress\r\n. . .to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of\r\npoverty.  But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of\r\nhostile powers.  Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them\r\nto oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. . .and let\r\nevery other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master\r\nof its own house.\r\n\r\nTo that world assembly of sovereign states:  the United Nations. . .\r\nour last best hope in an age where the instruments of war\r\nhave far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge\r\nof support. . .to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for\r\ninvective. . .to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak. . .\r\nand to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.\r\n\r\nFinally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversaries,\r\nwe offer not a pledge but a request:  that both sides begin anew\r\nthe quest for peace; before the dark powers of destruction unleashed\r\nby science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.\r\nWe dare not tempt them with weakness.  For only when our arms are sufficient\r\nbeyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.\r\nBut neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from\r\nour present course. . .both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons,\r\nboth rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing\r\nto alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of Mankind's\r\nfinal war.\r\n\r\nSo let us begin anew. . .remembering on both sides that civility\r\nis not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof.\r\nLet us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.\r\nLet both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring\r\nthose problems which divide us.  Let both sides, for the first time,\r\nformulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and\r\ncontrol of arms. . .and bring the absolute power to destroy\r\nother nations under the absolute control of all nations.\r\nLet both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead\r\nof its terrors.  Together let us explore the stars, conquer the\r\ndeserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage\r\nthe arts and commerce.  Let both sides unite to heed in all corners\r\nof the earth the command of Isaiah. . .to \"undo the heavy burdens. . .\r\nlet the oppressed go free.\"\r\n\r\nAnd if a beachhead of co-operation may push back the jungle of suspicion. . .\r\nlet both sides join in creating not a new balance of power. . .\r\nbut a new world of law. . .where the strong are just. . .\r\nand the weak secure. . .and the peace preserved. . . .\r\n\r\nAll this will not be finished in the first one hundred days.\r\nNor will it be finished in the first one thousand days. . .\r\nnor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps\r\nin our lifetime on this planet.  But let us begin.\r\n\r\nIn your hands, my fellow citizens. . .more than mine. . .will rest the\r\nfinal success or failure of our course.  Since this country was founded,\r\neach generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony\r\nto its national loyalty.  The graves of young Americans who answered\r\nthe call to service surround the globe.  Now the trumpet summons us again. . .\r\nnot as a call to bear arms, though arms we need. . .not as a call to battle. . .\r\nthough embattled we are. . .but a call to bear the burden of a long\r\ntwilight struggle. . .year in and year out, rejoicing in hope,\r\npatient in tribulation. . .a struggle against the common enemies of man:\r\ntyranny. . .poverty. . .disease. . .and war itself.  Can we forge against\r\nthese enemies a grand and global alliance. . .North and South. . .\r\nEast and West. . .that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind?\r\nWill you join in that historic effort?\r\n\r\nIn the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted\r\nthe role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger; I do not shrink\r\nfrom this responsibility. . .I welcome it.  I do not believe that any of us\r\nwould exchange places with any other people or any other generation.\r\nThe energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor\r\nwill light our country and all who serve it. . .and the glow from\r\nthat fire can truly light the world.\r\n\r\nAnd so, my fellow Americans. . .ask not what your country can\r\ndo for you. . .ask what you can do for your country.  My fellow\r\ncitizens of the world. . .ask not what America will do for you,\r\nbut what together we can do for the Freedom of Man.\r\n\r\nFinally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world,\r\nask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice\r\nwhich we ask of you.  With a good conscience our only sure reward,\r\nwith history the final judge of our deeds; let us go forth to lead\r\nthe land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that\r\nhere on earth God's work must truly be our own.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT", " do for the Freedom of Man.\r\n\r\nFinally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world,\r\nask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice\r\nwhich we ask of you.
