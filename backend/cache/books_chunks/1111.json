["*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 1111 ***\r\n\r\nThe life and death of King Richard the Second\r\n\r\nActus Primus, Scaena Prima.\r\n\r\nEnter King Richard, Iohn of Gaunt, with other Nobles and\r\nAttendants.\r\n\r\n  King Richard. Old Iohn of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster,\r\nHast thou according to thy oath and band\r\nBrought hither Henry Herford thy bold son:\r\nHeere to make good y boistrous late appeale,\r\nWhich then our leysure would not let vs heare,\r\nAgainst the Duke of Norfolke, Thomas Mowbray?\r\n  Gaunt. I haue my Liege\r\n\r\n   King. Tell me moreouer, hast thou sounded him,\r\nIf he appeale the Duke on ancient malice,\r\nOr worthily as a good subiect should\r\nOn some knowne ground of treacherie in him\r\n\r\n   Gaunt. As neere as I could sift him on that argument,\r\nOn some apparant danger seene in him,\r\nAym'd at your Highnesse, no inueterate malice\r\n\r\n   Kin. Then call them to our presence face to face,\r\nAnd frowning brow to brow, our selues will heare\r\nTh' accuser, and the accused, freely speake;\r\nHigh stomack'd are they both, and full of ire,\r\nIn rage, deafe as the sea; hastie as fire.\r\nEnter Bullingbrooke and Mowbray.\r\n\r\n  Bul. Many yeares of happy dayes befall\r\nMy gracious Soueraigne, my most louing Liege\r\n\r\n   Mow. Each day still better others happinesse,\r\nVntill the heauens enuying earths good hap,\r\nAdde an immortall title to your Crowne\r\n\r\n   King. We thanke you both, yet one but flatters vs,\r\nAs well appeareth by the cause you come,\r\nNamely, to appeale each other of high treason.\r\nCoosin of Hereford, what dost thou obiect\r\nAgainst the Duke of Norfolke, Thomas Mowbray?\r\n  Bul. First, heauen be the record to my speech,\r\nIn the deuotion of a subiects loue,\r\nTendering the precious safetie of my Prince,\r\nAnd free from other misbegotten hate,\r\nCome I appealant to this Princely presence.\r\nNow Thomas Mowbray do I turne to thee,\r\nAnd marke my greeting well: for what I speake,\r\nMy body shall make good vpon this earth,\r\nOr my diuine soule answer it in heauen.\r\nThou art a Traitor, and a Miscreant;\r\nToo good to be so, and too bad to liue,\r\nSince the more faire and christall is the skie,\r\nThe vglier seeme the cloudes that in it flye:\r\nOnce more, the more to aggrauate the note,\r\nWith a foule Traitors name stuffe I thy throte,\r\nAnd wish (so please my Soueraigne) ere I moue,\r\nWhat my tong speaks, my right drawn sword may proue\r\n  Mow. Let not my cold words heere accuse my zeale:\r\n'Tis not the triall of a Womans warre,\r\nThe bitter clamour of two eager tongues,\r\nCan arbitrate this cause betwixt vs twaine:\r\nThe blood is hot that must be cool'd for this.\r\nYet can I not of such tame patience boast,\r\nAs to be husht, and nought at all to say.\r\nFirst the faire reuerence of your Highnesse curbes mee,\r\nFrom giuing reines and spurres to my free speech,\r\nWhich else would post, vntill it had return'd\r\nThese tearmes of treason, doubly downe his throat.\r\nSetting aside his high bloods royalty,\r\nAnd let him be no Kinsman to my Liege,\r\nI do defie him, and I spit at him,\r\nCall him a slanderous Coward, and a Villaine:\r\nWhich to maintaine, I would allow him oddes,\r\nAnd meete him, were I tide to runne afoote,\r\nEuen to the frozen ridges of the Alpes,\r\nOr any other ground inhabitable,\r\nWhere euer Englishman durst set his foote.\r\nMeane time, let this defend my loyaltie,\r\nBy all my hopes most falsely doth he lie\r\n\r\n   Bul. Pale trembling Coward, there I throw my gage,\r\nDisclaiming heere the kindred of a King,\r\nAnd lay aside my high bloods Royalty,\r\nWhich feare, not reuerence makes thee to except.\r\nIf guilty dread hath left thee so much strength,\r\nAs to take vp mine Honors pawne, then stoope.\r\nBy that, and all the rites of Knight-hood else,\r\nWill I make good against thee arme to arme,\r\nWhat I haue spoken, or thou canst deuise\r\n\r\n   Mow. I take it vp, and by that sword I sweare,\r\nWhich gently laid my Knight-hood on my shoulder,\r\nIle answer thee in any faire degree,\r\nOr Chiualrous designe of knightly triall:\r\nAnd when I mount, aliue may I not light,\r\nIf I be Traitor, or vniustly fight\r\n\r\n   King. What doth our Cosin lay to Mowbraies charge?\r\nIt must be great that can inherite vs,\r\nSo much as of a thought of ill in him\r\n\r\n   Bul. Looke what I said, my life shall proue it true,\r\nThat Mowbray hath receiu'd eight thousand Nobles,\r\nIn name of lendings for your Highnesse Soldiers,\r\nThe which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,\r\nLike a false Traitor, and iniurious Villaine.\r\nBesides I say, and will in battaile proue,\r\nOr heere, or elsewhere to the furthest Verge\r\nThat euer was suruey'd by English eye,\r\nThat all the Treasons for these eighteene yeeres\r\nComplotted, and contriued in this Land,\r\nFetch'd from false Mowbray their first head and", "The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,\r\nLike a false Traitor, and iniurious Villaine.\r\nBesides I say, and will in battaile proue,\r\nOr heere, or elsewhere to the furthest Verge\r\nThat euer was suruey'd by English eye,\r\nThat all the Treasons for these eighteene yeeres\r\nComplotted, and contriued in this Land,\r\nFetch'd from false Mowbray their first head and spring.\r\nFurther I say, and further will maintaine\r\nVpon his bad life, to make all this good.\r\nThat he did plot the Duke of Glousters death,\r\nSuggest his soone beleeuing aduersaries,\r\nAnd consequently, like a Traitor Coward,\r\nSluc'd out his innocent soule through streames of blood:\r\nWhich blood, like sacrificing Abels cries,\r\n(Euen from the toonglesse cauernes of the earth)\r\nTo me for iustice, and rough chasticement:\r\nAnd by the glorious worth of my discent,\r\nThis arme shall do it, or this life be spent\r\n\r\n   King. How high a pitch his resolution soares:\r\nThomas of Norfolke, what sayest thou to this?\r\n  Mow. Oh let my Soueraigne turne away his face,\r\nAnd bid his eares a little while be deafe,\r\nTill I haue told this slander of his blood,\r\nHow God, and good men, hate so foule a lyar\r\n\r\n   King. Mowbray, impartiall are our eyes and eares,\r\nWere he my brother, nay our kingdomes heyre,\r\nAs he is but my fathers brothers sonne;\r\nNow by my Scepters awe, I make a vow,\r\nSuch neighbour-neerenesse to our sacred blood,\r\nShould nothing priuiledge him, nor partialize\r\nThe vn-stooping firmenesse of my vpright soule.\r\nHe is our subiect (Mowbray) so art thou,\r\nFree speech, and fearelesse, I to thee allow\r\n\r\n   Mow. Then Bullingbrooke, as low as to thy heart,\r\nThrough the false passage of thy throat; thou lyest:\r\nThree parts of that receipt I had for Callice,\r\nDisburst I to his Highnesse souldiers;\r\nThe other part reseru'd I by consent,\r\nFor that my Soueraigne Liege was in my debt,\r\nVpon remainder of a deere Accompt,\r\nSince last I went to France to fetch his Queene:\r\nNow swallow downe that Lye. For Glousters death,\r\nI slew him not; but (to mine owne disgrace)\r\nNeglected my sworne duty in that case:\r\nFor you my noble Lord of Lancaster,\r\nThe honourable Father to my foe,\r\nOnce I did lay an ambush for your life,\r\nA trespasse that doth vex my greeued soule:\r\nBut ere I last receiu'd the Sacrament,\r\nI did confesse it, and exactly begg'd\r\nYour Graces pardon, and I hope I had it.\r\nThis is my fault: as for the rest appeal'd,\r\nIt issues from the rancour of a Villaine,\r\nA recreant, and most degenerate Traitor,\r\nWhich in my selfe I boldly will defend,\r\nAnd interchangeably hurle downe my gage\r\nVpon this ouer-weening Traitors foote,\r\nTo proue my selfe a loyall Gentleman,\r\nEuen in the best blood chamber'd in his bosome.\r\nIn hast whereof, most heartily I pray\r\nYour Highnesse to assigne our Triall day\r\n\r\n   King. Wrath-kindled Gentlemen be rul'd by me:\r\nLet's purge this choller without letting blood:\r\nThis we prescribe, though no Physition,\r\nDeepe malice makes too deepe incision.\r\nForget, forgiue, conclude, and be agreed,\r\nOur Doctors say, This is no time to bleed.\r\nGood Vnckle, let this end where it begun,\r\nWee'l calme the Duke of Norfolke; you, your son\r\n\r\n   Gaunt. To be a make-peace shall become my age,\r\nThrow downe (my sonne) the Duke of Norfolkes gage\r\n\r\n   King. And Norfolke, throw downe his\r\n\r\n   Gaunt. When Harrie when? Obedience bids,\r\nObedience bids I should not bid agen\r\n\r\n   King. Norfolke, throw downe, we bidde; there is\r\nno boote\r\n\r\n   Mow. My selfe I throw (dread Soueraigne) at thy foot.\r\nMy life thou shalt command, but not my shame,\r\nThe one my dutie owes, but my faire name\r\nDespight of death, that liues vpon my graue\r\nTo darke dishonours vse, thou shalt not haue.\r\nI am disgrac'd, impeach'd, and baffel'd heere,\r\nPierc'd to the soule with slanders venom'd speare:\r\nThe which no balme can cure, but his heart blood\r\nWhich breath'd this poyson\r\n\r\n   King. Rage must be withstood:\r\nGiue me his gage: Lyons make Leopards tame\r\n\r\n   Mo. Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame,\r\nAnd I resigne my gage. My deere, deere Lord,\r\nThe purest treasure mortall times afford\r\nIs spotlesse reputation: that away,\r\nMen are but gilded loame, or painted clay.\r\nA Iewell in a ten times barr'd vp Chest,\r\nIs a bold spirit, in a loyall brest.\r\nMine Honor is my life; both grow in one:\r\nTake Honor from me, and my life is done.\r\nThen (deere my Liege) mine Honor let me trie,\r\nIn that I liue; and for that will I die\r\n\r\n   King. Coosin, throw downe your gage,\r\nDo you begin\r\n\r\n   Bul. Oh heauen defend my soule from such foule sin.\r\nShall I seeme Crest-falne in my fathers sight,\r\nOr with pale beggar-feare impeach my", " grow in one:\r\nTake Honor from me, and my life is done.\r\nThen (deere my Liege) mine Honor let me trie,\r\nIn that I liue; and for that will I die\r\n\r\n   King. Coosin, throw downe your gage,\r\nDo you begin\r\n\r\n   Bul. Oh heauen defend my soule from such foule sin.\r\nShall I seeme Crest-falne in my fathers sight,\r\nOr with pale beggar-feare impeach my hight\r\nBefore this out-dar'd dastard? Ere my toong,\r\nShall wound mine honor with such feeble wrong;\r\nOr sound so base a parle: my teeth shall teare\r\nThe slauish motiue of recanting feare,\r\nAnd spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,\r\nWhere shame doth harbour, euen in Mowbrayes face.\r\n\r\nExit Gaunt.\r\n\r\n  King. We were not borne to sue, but to command,\r\nWhich since we cannot do to make you friends,\r\nBe readie, (as your liues shall answer it)\r\nAt Couentree, vpon S[aint]. Lamberts day:\r\nThere shall your swords and Lances arbitrate\r\nThe swelling difference of your setled hate:\r\nSince we cannot attone you, you shall see\r\nIustice designe the Victors Chiualrie.\r\nLord Marshall, command our Officers at Armes,\r\nBe readie to direct these home Alarmes.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nScaena Secunda.\r\n\r\nEnter Gaunt, and Dutchesse of Gloucester.\r\n\r\n  Gaunt. Alas, the part I had in Glousters blood,\r\nDoth more solicite me then your exclaimes,\r\nTo stirre against the Butchers of his life.\r\nBut since correction lyeth in those hands\r\nWhich made the fault that we cannot correct,\r\nPut we our quarrell to the will of heauen,\r\nWho when they see the houres ripe on earth,\r\nWill raigne hot vengeance on offenders heads\r\n\r\n   Dut. Findes brotherhood in thee no sharper spurre?\r\nHath loue in thy old blood no liuing fire?\r\nEdwards seuen sonnes (whereof thy selfe art one)\r\nWere as seuen violles of his Sacred blood,\r\nOr seuen faire branches springing from one roote:\r\nSome of those seuen are dride by natures course,\r\nSome of those branches by the destinies cut:\r\nBut Thomas, my deere Lord, my life, my Glouster,\r\nOne Violl full of Edwards Sacred blood,\r\nOne flourishing branch of his most Royall roote\r\nIs crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt;\r\nIs hackt downe, and his summer leafes all vaded\r\nBy Enuies hand, and Murders bloody Axe.\r\nAh Gaunt! His blood was thine, that bed, that wombe,\r\nThat mettle, that selfe-mould that fashion'd thee,\r\nMade him a man: and though thou liu'st, and breath'st,\r\nYet art thou slaine in him: thou dost consent\r\nIn some large measure to thy Fathers death,\r\nIn that thou seest thy wretched brother dye,\r\nWho was the modell of thy Fathers life.\r\nCall it not patience (Gaunt) it is dispaire,\r\nIn suffring thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,\r\nThou shew'st the naked pathway to thy life,\r\nTeaching sterne murther how to butcher thee:\r\nThat which in meane men we intitle patience\r\nIs pale cold cowardice in noble brests:\r\nWhat shall I say, to safegard thine owne life,\r\nThe best way is to venge my Glousters death\r\n\r\n   Gaunt. Heauens is the quarrell: for heauens substitute\r\nHis Deputy annointed in his sight,\r\nHath caus'd his death, the which if wrongfully\r\nLet heauen reuenge: for I may neuer lift\r\nAn angry arme against his Minister\r\n\r\n   Dut.
