It is\r\nencompassed on two sides by what was once a garden, though now but a\r\nbarren patch of stones and dust where clothes--it is odd any one should\r\nhave thought of washing--hang in perpetuity; while about the door\r\ncontinue the remnants of a porch, which the stucco falling has left\r\nexposed in all its naked insincerity.\r\n\r\nOccasionally I drift hitherward in the day time, when slatternly women\r\ngossip round the area gates, and the silence is broken by the\r\nhoarse, wailing cry of “Coals--any coals--three and sixpence a\r\nsack--co-o-o-als!” chanted in a tone that absence of response has\r\nstamped with chronic melancholy; but then the street knows me not, and\r\nmy old friend of the corner, ashamed of its shabbiness in the unpitying\r\nsunlight, turns its face away, and will not see me as I pass.\r\n\r\nNot until the Night, merciful alone of all things to the ugly, draws her\r\nveil across its sordid features will it, as some fond old nurse, sought\r\nout in after years, open wide its arms to welcome me. Then the teeming\r\nlife it now shelters, hushed for a time within its walls, the flickering\r\nflare from the “King of Prussia” opposite extinguished, will it talk\r\nwith me of the past, asking me many questions, reminding me of\r\nmany things I had forgotten. Then into the silent street come the\r\nwell-remembered footsteps; in and out the creaking gate pass, not seeing\r\nme, the well-remembered faces; and we talk concerning them; as two\r\ncronies, turning the torn leaves of some old album where the faded\r\nportraits in forgotten fashions, speak together in low tones of those\r\nnow dead or scattered, with now a smile and now a sigh, and many an “Ah\r\nme!” or “Dear, dear!”\r\n\r\nThis bent, worn man, coming towards us with quick impatient steps, which\r\nyet cease every fifty yards or so, while he pauses, leaning heavily upon\r\nhis high Malacca cane: “It is a handsome face, is it not?” I ask, as I\r\ngaze upon it, shadow framed.\r\n\r\n“Aye, handsome enough,” answers the old House; “and handsomer still it\r\nmust have been before you and I knew it, before mean care had furrowed\r\nit with fretful lines.”\r\n\r\n“I never could make out,” continues the old House, musingly, “whom you\r\ntook after; for they were a handsome pair, your father and your mother,\r\nthough Lord! what a couple of children!”\r\n\r\n“Children!” I say in surprise, for my father must have been past five\r\nand thirty before the House could have known him, and my mother's face\r\nis very close to mine, in the darkness, so that I see the many grey\r\nhairs mingling with the bonny brown.\r\n\r\n“Children,” repeats the old House, irritably, so it seems to me, not\r\nliking, perhaps, its opinions questioned, a failing common to old folk;\r\n“the most helpless pair of children I ever set eyes upon. Who but\r\na child, I should like to know, would have conceived the notion of\r\nrepairing his fortune by becoming a solicitor at thirty-eight, or,\r\nhaving conceived such a notion, would have selected the outskirts of\r\nPoplar as a likely centre in which to put up his door-plate?”\r\n\r\n“It was considered to be a rising neighbourhood,” I reply, a little\r\nresentful. No son cares to hear the family wisdom criticised, even\r\nthough at the bottom of his heart he may be in agreement with the\r\ncritic. “All sorts and conditions of men, whose affairs were in\r\nconnection with the sea would, it was thought, come to reside hereabout,\r\nso as to be near to the new docks; and had they, it is not unreasonable\r\nto suppose they would have quarrelled and disputed with one another,\r\nmuch to the advantage of a cute solicitor, convenient to their hand.”\r\n\r\n“Stuff and nonsense,” retorts the old House, shortly; “why, the mere\r\nsmell of the place would have been sufficient to keep a sensible man\r\naway. And”--the grim brick face before me twists itself into a goblin\r\nsmile--“he, of all men in the world, as 'the cute solicitor,' giving\r\nadvice to shady clients, eager to get out of trouble by the shortest\r\nway", " solicitor, convenient to their hand.”\r\n\r\n“Stuff and nonsense,” retorts the old House, shortly; “why, the mere\r\nsmell of the place would have been sufficient to keep a sensible man\r\naway. And”--the grim brick face before me twists itself into a goblin\r\nsmile--“he, of all men in the world, as 'the cute solicitor,' giving\r\nadvice to shady clients, eager to get out of trouble by the shortest\r\nway, can you fancy it! he who for two years starved himself, living on\r\nfive shillings a week--that was before you came to London, when he\r\nwas here alone. Even your mother knew nothing of it till years\r\nafterwards--so that no man should be a penny the poorer for having\r\ntrusted his good name. Do you think the crew of chandlers and brokers,\r\ndock hustlers and freight wreckers would have found him a useful man of\r\nbusiness, even had they come to settle here?”\r\n\r\nI have no answer; nor does the old House wait for any, but talks on.\r\n\r\n“And your mother! would any but a child have taken that soft-tongued\r\nwanton to her bosom, and not have seen through acting so transparent?\r\nWould any but the veriest child that never ought to have been let out\r\ninto the world by itself have thought to dree her weird in such folly?\r\nChildren! poor babies they were, both of them.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” I say--for at such times all my stock of common sense is not\r\nsufficient to convince me that the old House is but clay. From its walls\r\nso full of voices, from its floors so thick with footsteps, surely it\r\nhas learned to live; as a violin, long played on, comes to learn at last\r\na music of its own. “Tell me, I was but a child to whom life speaks in a\r\nstrange tongue, was there any truth in the story?”\r\n\r\n“Truth!” snaps out the old House; “just truth enough to plant a lie\r\nupon; and Lord knows not much ground is needed for that weed. I saw\r\nwhat I saw, and I know what I know. Your mother had a good man, and\r\nyour father a true wife, but it was the old story: a man's way is not a\r\nwoman's way, and a woman's way is not a man's way, so there lives ever\r\ndoubt between them.”\r\n\r\n“But they came together in the end,” I say, remembering.\r\n\r\n“Aye, in the end,” answers the House. “That is when you begin to\r\nunderstand, you men and women, when you come to the end.”\r\n\r\nThe grave face of a not too recently washed angel peeps shyly at\r\nme through the railings, then, as I turn my head, darts back and\r\ndisappears.\r\n\r\n“What has become of her?” I ask.\r\n\r\n“She? Oh, she is well enough,” replies the House. “She lives close here.\r\nYou must have passed the shop. You might have seen her had you looked\r\nin. She weighs fourteen stone, about; and has nine children living. She\r\nwould be pleased to see you.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” I say, with a laugh that is not wholly a laugh; “I do not\r\nthink I will call.” But I still hear the pit-pat of her tiny feet, dying\r\ndown the long street.\r\n\r\nThe faces thicken round me. A large looming, rubicund visage smiles\r\nkindly on me, bringing back into my heart the old, odd mingling of\r\ninstinctive liking held in check by conscientious disapproval. I turn\r\nfrom it, and see a massive, clean-shaven face, with the ugliest mouth\r\nand the loveliest eyes I ever have known in a man.\r\n\r\n“Was he as bad, do you think, as they said?” I ask of my ancient friend.\r\n\r\n“Shouldn't wonder,” the old House answers. “I never knew a worse--nor a\r\nbetter.”\r\n\r\nThe wind whisks it aside, leaving to view a little old woman, hobbling\r\nnimbly by aid of a stick. Three corkscrew curls each side of her head\r\nbob with each step she takes, and as she draws near to me, making the\r\nmost alarming grimaces, I hear her whisper, as though confiding to\r\nherself some fascinating secret, “I'd like to skin 'em. I'd like to skin\r\n'em all. I'd like to skin 'em all alive!”\r\n\r\nIt sounds a fiendish sentiment, yet I only laugh, and the little old\r\nlady, with a final facial contortion surpassing all dreams, limps beyond\r\nmy ken.\r\n\r\nThen, as though choosing contrasts, follows a fair, laughing face. I saw\r\nit in the life only a few hours ago--at least, not it, but the poor daub\r\nthat Evil has painted over it, hating the sweetness underlying. And as\r\nI stand gazing at it, wishing it were of the dead who change not, there\r\ndrifts back from the shadows that other face, the one of the wicked\r\nmouth and the tender eyes, so that I stand again helpless between the\r\ntwo I loved so well, he from whom I learned my first steps in manhood,\r\nshe from whom I caught my first glimpse of the beauty and the mystery of\r\nwoman. And again the cry rises from my heart, “Whose fault was it--yours\r\nor hers?” And again I hear his mocking laugh as he answers, “Whose\r\nfault? God made us.” And thinking of her and of the love I bore her,\r\nwhich was as the love of a young pilgrim to a saint, it comes into my\r\nblood to hate him. But when I look into his eyes and see the pain that\r\nlives there, my pity grows stronger than my misery, and I can only echo\r\nhis words, “God made us.”\r\n\r\nMerry faces and sad, fair faces and foul, they ride upon the wind; but\r\nthe centre round which they circle remains always the one: a little\r\nlad with golden curls more suitable to a girl than to a boy, with shy,\r\nawkward ways and a silent tongue, and a grave, old-fashioned face.\r\n\r\nAnd, turning from him to my old brick friend, I ask: “Would he know me,\r\ncould he see me, do you think?”\r\n\r\n“How should he,” answers the old House, “you are so different to what he\r\nwould expect. Would you recognise your own ghost, think you?”\r\n\r\n“It is sad to think he would not recognise me,” I say.\r\n\r\n“It might be sadder if he did,” grumbles the old House.\r\n\r\nWe both remained silent for awhile; but I know of what the old House is\r\nthinking. Soon it speaks as I expected.\r\n\r\n“You--writer of stories, why don't you write a book about him? There is\r\nsomething that you know.”\r\n\r\nIt is the favourite theme of the old House. I never visit it but it\r\nsuggests to me this idea.\r\n\r\n“But he has done nothing?” I say.\r\n\r\n“He has lived,” answers the old House. “Is not that enough?”\r\n\r\n“Aye, but only in London in these prosaic modern times,” I persist. “How\r\nof such can one make a story that shall interest the people?”\r\n\r\nThe old House waxes impatient of me.\r\n\r\n“'The people!'” it retorts, “what are you all but children in a dim-lit\r\nroom, waiting until one by one you are called out to sleep. And one\r\nmounts upon a stool and tells a tale to the others who have gathered\r\nround. Who shall say what will please them, what will not.”\r\n\r\nReturning home with musing footsteps through the softly breathing\r\nstreets, I ponder the words of the old House. Is it but as some foolish\r\nmother thinking all the world interested in her child, or may there lie\r\nwisdom in its counsel? Then to my guidance or misguidance comes the\r\nthought of a certain small section of the Public who often of an evening\r\ncommands of me a story; and who, when I have told her of the dreadful\r\ngiants and of the gallant youths who slay them, of the wood-cutter's\r\nsons who rescue maidens from Ogre-guarded castles; of the Princesses the\r\nmost beautiful in all the world, of the Princes with magic swords, still\r\nunsatisfied, creeps closer yet, saying: “Now tell me a real story,”\r\nadding for my", " often of an evening\r\ncommands of me a story; and who, when I have told her of the dreadful\r\ngiants and of the gallant youths who slay them, of the wood-cutter's\r\nsons who rescue maidens from Ogre-guarded castles; of the Princesses the\r\nmost beautiful in all the world, of the Princes with magic swords, still\r\nunsatisfied, creeps closer yet, saying: “Now tell me a real story,”\r\nadding for my comprehending: “You know: about a little girl who lived in\r\na big house with her father and mother, and who was sometimes naughty,\r\nyou know.”\r\n\r\nSo perhaps among the many there may be some who for a moment will turn\r\naside from tales of haughty Heroes, ruffling it in Court and Camp, to\r\nlisten to the story of a very ordinary lad who lived with very ordinary\r\nfolk in a modern London street, and who grew up to be a very ordinary\r\nsort of man, loving a little and grieving a little, helping a few and\r\nharming a few, struggling and failing and hoping; and if any such there\r\nbe, let them come round me.\r\n\r\nBut let not those who come to me grow indignant as they listen, saying:\r\n“This rascal tells us but a humdrum story, where nothing is as it should\r\nbe;” for I warn all beforehand that I tell but of things that I have\r\nseen. My villains, I fear, are but poor sinners, not altogether bad;\r\nand my good men but sorry saints. My princes do not always slay their\r\ndragons; alas, sometimes, the dragon eats the prince. The wicked\r\nfairies often prove more powerful than the good. The magic thread leads\r\nsometimes wrong, and even the hero is not always brave and true.\r\n\r\nSo let those come round me only who will be content to hear but their\r\nown story, told by another, saying as they listen, “So dreamt I. Ah,\r\nyes, that is true, I remember.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nPAUL, ARRIVED IN A STRANGE LAND, LEARNS MANY THINGS, AND GOES TO MEET\r\nTHE MAN IN GREY.\r\n\r\nFate intended me for a singularly fortunate man. Properly, I ought to\r\nhave been born in June, which being, as is well known, the luckiest\r\nmonth in all the year for such events, should, by thoughtful parents, be\r\nmore generally selected. How it was I came to be born in May, which is,\r\non the other hand, of all the twelve the most unlucky, as I have proved,\r\nI leave to those more conversant with the subject to explain. An early\r\nnurse, the first human being of whom I have any distinct recollection,\r\nunhesitatingly attributed the unfortunate fact to my natural impatience;\r\nwhich quality she at the same time predicted would lead me into even\r\ngreater trouble, a prophecy impressed by future events with the stamp of\r\nprescience. It was from this same bony lady that I likewise learned the\r\nmanner of my coming. It seems that I arrived, quite unexpectedly, two\r\nhours after news had reached the house of the ruin of my father's mines\r\nthrough inundation; misfortunes, as it was expounded to me, never coming\r\nsingly in this world to any one. That all things might be of a piece,\r\nmy poor mother, attempting to reach the bell, fell against and broke the\r\ncheval-glass, thus further saddening herself with the conviction--for\r\nno amount of reasoning ever succeeded in purging her Welsh blood of\r\nits natural superstition--that whatever might be the result of future\r\nbattles with my evil star, the first seven years of tiny existence had\r\nbeen, by her act, doomed to disaster.\r\n\r\n“And I must confess,” added the knobbly Mrs. Fursey, with a sigh, “it\r\ndoes look as though there must be some truth in the saying, after all.”\r\n\r\n“Then ain't I a lucky little boy?” I asked. For hitherto it had been\r\nMrs. Fursey's method to impress upon me my exceptional good fortune.\r\nThat I could and did, involuntarily, retire to bed at six, while less\r\nhappily placed children were deprived of their natural rest until eight\r\nor nine o'clock, had always been held up to me as an astounding piece of\r\nluck. Some little boys had not a bed at all; for the which, in my more\r\nriotous moments, I envied them. Again, that at the first sign of a cold\r\nit became my unavoidable privilege to lunch off linseed gruel and sup\r\noff brimstone and treacle--a compound named with deliberate intent to\r\ndeceive the innocent, the treacle, so far as taste is concerned, being\r\nwickedly subordinated to the brimstone--was another example of Fortune's\r\nfavouritism: other little boys were so astoundingly unlucky as to be\r\nleft alone when they felt ill. If further proof were needed to convince\r\nthat I had been signalled out by Providence as its especial protege,\r\nthere remained always the circumstance that I possessed Mrs. Fursey\r\nfor my nurse. The suggestion that I was not altogether the luckiest of\r\nchildren was a new departure.\r\n\r\nThe good dame evidently perceived her error, and made haste to correct\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you! You are lucky enough,” she replied; “I was thinking of your\r\npoor mother.”\r\n\r\n“Isn't mamma lucky?”\r\n\r\n“Well, she hasn't been too lucky since you came.”\r\n\r\n“Wasn't it lucky, her having me?”\r\n\r\n“I can't say it was, at that particular time.”\r\n\r\n“Didn't she want me?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Fursey was one of those well-meaning persons who are of opinion\r\nthat the only reasonable attitude of childhood should be that of\r\nperpetual apology for its existence.\r\n\r\n“Well, I daresay she could have done without you,” was the answer.\r\n\r\nI can see the picture plainly still. I am sitting on a low chair before\r\nthe nursery fire, one knee supported in my locked hands, meanwhile Mrs.\r\nFursey's needle grated with monotonous regularity against her thimble.\r\nAt that moment knocked at my small soul for the first time the problem\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, without moving, I said:\r\n\r\n“Then why did she take me in?”\r\n\r\nThe rasping click of the needle on the thimble ceased abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Took you in! What's the child talking about? Who's took you in?”\r\n\r\n“Why, mamma. If she didn't want me, why did she take me in?”\r\n\r\nBut even while, with heart full of dignified resentment, I propounded\r\nthis, as I proudly felt, logically unanswerable question, I was glad\r\nthat she had. The vision of my being refused at the bedroom window\r\npresented itself to my imagination. I saw the stork, perplexed and\r\nannoyed, looking as I had sometimes seen Tom Pinfold look when the fish\r\nhe had been holding out by the tail had been sniffed at by Anna, and\r\nthe kitchen door shut in his face. Would the stork also have gone away\r\nthoughtfully scratching his head with one of those long, compass-like\r\nlegs of his, and muttering to himself. And here, incidentally, I fell\r\na-wondering how the stork had carried me. In the garden I had often\r\nwatched a blackbird carrying a worm, and the worm, though no doubt\r\nreally safe enough, had always appeared to me nervous and uncomfortable.\r\nHad I wriggled and squirmed in like fashion? And where would the stork\r\nhave taken me to then? Possibly to Mrs. Fursey's: their cottage was the\r\nnearest. But I felt sure Mrs. Fursey would not have taken me in; and\r\nnext to them, at the first house in the village, lived Mr. Chumdley,\r\nthe cobbler, who was lame, and who sat all day hammering boots with\r\nvery dirty hands, in a little cave half under the ground, his whole\r\nappearance suggesting a poor-spirited ogre. I should have hated being\r\nhis little boy. Possibly nobody would have taken me in. I grew pensive,\r\nthinking of myself as the rejected of all the village. What would the\r\nstork have done with me, left on his hands, so to speak. The reflection\r\nprompted a fresh question.\r\n\r\n“Nurse, where did I come from?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I've told", " little cave half under the ground, his whole\r\nappearance suggesting a poor-spirited ogre. I should have hated being\r\nhis little boy. Possibly nobody would have taken me in. I grew pensive,\r\nthinking of myself as the rejected of all the village. What would the\r\nstork have done with me, left on his hands, so to speak. The reflection\r\nprompted a fresh question.\r\n\r\n“Nurse, where did I come from?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I've told you often. The stork brought you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know. But where did the stork get me from?” Mrs. Fursey paused\r\nfor quite a long while before replying. Possibly she was reflecting\r\nwhether such answer might not make me unduly conceited. Eventually she\r\nmust have decided to run that risk; other opportunities could be relied\r\nupon for neutralising the effect.\r\n\r\n“Oh, from Heaven.”\r\n\r\n“But I thought Heaven was a place where you went to,” I answered; “not\r\nwhere you comed from.” I know I said “comed,” for I remember that at\r\nthis period my irregular verbs were a bewildering anxiety to my poor\r\nmother. “Comed” and “goned,” which I had worked out for myself, were\r\nparticular favourites of mine.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fursey passed over my grammar in dignified silence. She had\r\nbeen pointedly requested not to trouble herself with that part of my\r\neducation, my mother holding that diverging opinions upon the same\r\nsubject only confused a child.\r\n\r\n“You came from Heaven,” repeated Mrs. Fursey, “and you'll go to\r\nHeaven--if you're good.”\r\n\r\n“Do all little boys and girls come from Heaven?”\r\n\r\n“So they say.” Mrs. Fursey's tone implied that she was stating what\r\nmight possibly be but a popular fallacy, for which she individually took\r\nno responsibility.\r\n\r\n“And did you come from Heaven, Mrs. Fursey?” Mrs. Fursey's reply to this\r\nwas decidedly more emphatic.\r\n\r\n“Of course I did. Where do you think I came from?”\r\n\r\nAt once, I am ashamed to say, Heaven lost its exalted position in my\r\neyes. Even before this, it had puzzled me that everybody I knew should\r\nbe going there--for so I was always assured; now, connected as it\r\nappeared to be with the origin of Mrs. Fursey, much of its charm\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. Mrs. Fursey's information had suggested to me a\r\nfresh grief. I stopped not to console myself with the reflection that my\r\nfate had been but the fate of all little boys and girls. With a child's\r\negoism I seized only upon my own particular case.\r\n\r\n“Didn't they want me in Heaven then, either?” I asked. “Weren't they\r\nfond of me up there?”\r\n\r\nThe misery in my voice must have penetrated even Mrs. Fursey's bosom,\r\nfor she answered more sympathetically than usual.\r\n\r\n“Oh, they liked you well enough, I daresay. I like you, but I like to\r\nget rid of you sometimes.” There could be no doubt as to this last. Even\r\nat the time, I often doubted whether that six o'clock bedtime was not\r\noccasionally half-past five.\r\n\r\nThe answer comforted me not. It remained clear that I was not wanted\r\neither in Heaven nor upon the earth. God did not want me. He was glad\r\nto get rid of me. My mother did not want me. She could have done without\r\nme. Nobody wanted me. Why was I here?\r\n\r\nAnd then, as the sudden opening and shutting of the door of a dark room,\r\ncame into my childish brain the feeling that Something, somewhere, must\r\nhave need of me, or I could not be, Something I felt I belonged to and\r\nthat belonged to me, Something that was as much a part of me as I of It.\r\nThe feeling came back to me more than once during my childhood, though I\r\ncould never put it into words. Years later the son of the Portuguese Jew\r\nexplained to me my thought. But all that I myself could have told was\r\nthat in that moment I knew for the first time that I lived, that I was\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe next instant all was dark again, and I once more a puzzled little\r\nboy, sitting by a nursery fire, asking of a village dame questions\r\nconcerning life.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a new thought came to me, or rather the recollection of an old.\r\n\r\n“Nurse, why haven't we got a husband?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Fursey left off her sewing, and stared at me.\r\n\r\n“What maggot has the child got into its head now?” was her observation;\r\n“who hasn't got a husband?”\r\n\r\n“Why, mamma.”\r\n\r\n“Don't talk nonsense, Master Paul; you know your mamma has got a\r\nhusband.”\r\n\r\n“No, she ain't.”\r\n\r\n“And don't contradict. Your mamma's husband is your papa, who lives in\r\nLondon.”\r\n\r\n“What's the good of _him_!”\r\n\r\nMrs. Fursey's reply appeared to me to be unnecessarily vehement.\r\n\r\n“You wicked child, you; where's your commandments? Your father is in\r\nLondon working hard to earn money to keep you in idleness, and you sit\r\nthere and say 'What's the good of him!' I'd be ashamed to be such an\r\nungrateful little brat.”\r\n\r\nI had not meant to be ungrateful. My words were but the repetition of\r\na conversation I had overheard the day before between my mother and my\r\naunt.\r\n\r\nHad said my aunt: “There she goes, moping again. Drat me if ever I saw\r\nsuch a thing to mope as a woman.”\r\n\r\nMy aunt was entitled to preach on the subject. She herself grumbled all\r\nday about all things, but she did it cheerfully.\r\n\r\nMy mother was standing with her hands clasped behind her--a favourite\r\nattitude of hers--gazing through the high French window into the garden\r\nbeyond. It must have been spring time, for I remember the white and\r\nyellow crocuses decking the grass.\r\n\r\n“I want a husband,” had answered my mother, in a tone so ludicrously\r\nchildish that at sound of it I had looked up from the fairy story I was\r\nreading, half expectant to find her changed into a little girl; “I hate\r\nnot having a husband.”\r\n\r\n“Help us and save us,” my aunt had retorted; “how many more does a girl\r\nwant? She's got one.”\r\n\r\n“What's the good of him all that way off,” had pouted my mother; “I want\r\nhim here where I can get at him.”\r\n\r\nI had often heard of this father of mine, who lived far away in\r\nLondon, and to whom we owed all the blessings of life; but my childish\r\nendeavours to square information with reflection had resulted in my\r\nassigning to him an entirely spiritual existence. I agreed with my\r\nmother that such an one, however to be revered, was no substitute for\r\nthe flesh and blood father possessed by luckier folk--the big, strong,\r\nmasculine thing that would carry a fellow pig-a-back round the garden,\r\nor take a chap to sail in boats.\r\n\r\n“You don't understand me, nurse,” I explained; “what I mean is a husband\r\nyou can get at.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and you'll 'get at him,' poor gentleman, one of these days,”\r\n answered Mrs. Fursey. “When he's ready for you he'll send for you, and\r\nthen you'll go to him in London.”\r\n\r\nI felt that still Mrs. Fursey didn't understand. But I foresaw that\r\nfurther explanation would only shock her, so contented myself with a\r\nsimple, matter-of-fact question.\r\n\r\n“How do you get to London; do you have to die first?”\r\n\r\n“I do think,” said Mrs. Fursey, in the voice of resigned despair rather\r\nthan of surprise, “that, without exception, you are the silliest little\r\nboy I ever came across. I've no patience with you.”\r\n\r\n“I am very sorry, nurse,” I answered; “I thought--”\r\n\r\n“Then,” interrupted Mrs. Fursey, in the voice of many generations, “you\r\nshouldn't think. London,” continued the good dame, her experience no\r\ndoubt suggesting that the shortest road to peace would be through my\r\nunderstanding of this matter, “is a big town, and you go there in a\r\ntrain. Some time--soon now--your father will write to your mother that\r\n", " very sorry, nurse,” I answered; “I thought--”\r\n\r\n“Then,” interrupted Mrs. Fursey, in the voice of many generations, “you\r\nshouldn't think. London,” continued the good dame, her experience no\r\ndoubt suggesting that the shortest road to peace would be through my\r\nunderstanding of this matter, “is a big town, and you go there in a\r\ntrain. Some time--soon now--your father will write to your mother that\r\neverything is ready. Then you and your mother and your aunt will leave\r\nthis place and go to London, and I shall be rid of you.”\r\n\r\n“And shan't we come back here ever any more?”\r\n\r\n“Never again.”\r\n\r\n“And I'll never play in the garden again, never go down to the\r\npebble-ridge to tea, or to Jacob's tower?”\r\n\r\n“Never again.” I think Mrs. Fursey took a pleasure in the phrase. It\r\nsounded, as she said it, like something out of the prayer-book.\r\n\r\n“And I'll never see Anna, or Tom Pinfold, or old Yeo, or Pincher, or\r\nyou, ever any more?” In this moment of the crumbling from under me of\r\nall my footholds I would have clung even to that dry tuft, Mrs. Fursey\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n“Never any more. You'll go away and begin an entirely new life. And I do\r\nhope, Master Paul,” added Mrs. Fursey, piously, “it may be a better one.\r\nThat you will make up your mind to--”\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Fursey's well-meant exhortations, whatever they may have been,\r\nfell upon deaf ears. Here was I face to face with yet another problem.\r\nThis life into which I had fallen: it was understandable! One went away,\r\nleaving the pleasant places that one knew, never to return to them.\r\nOne left one's labour and one's play to enter upon a new existence in a\r\nstrange land. One parted from the friends one had always known, one saw\r\nthem never again. Life was indeed a strange thing; and, would a body\r\ncomprehend it, then must a body sit staring into the fire, thinking very\r\nhard, unheedful of all idle chatter.\r\n\r\nThat night, when my mother came to kiss me good-night, I turned my\r\nface to the wall and pretended to be asleep, for children as well as\r\ngrown-ups have their foolish moods; but when I felt the soft curls brush\r\nmy cheek, my pride gave way, and clasping my arms about her neck, and\r\ndrawing her face still closer down to mine; I voiced the question that\r\nall the evening had been knocking at my heart:\r\n\r\n“I suppose you couldn't send me back now, could you? You see, you've had\r\nme so long.”\r\n\r\n“Send you back?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I'd be too big for the stork to carry now, wouldn't I?”\r\n\r\nMy mother knelt down beside the bed so that her face and mine were on\r\na level, and looking into her eyes, the fear that had been haunting me\r\nfell from me.\r\n\r\n“Who has been talking foolishly to a foolish little boy?” asked my\r\nmother, keeping my arms still clasped about her neck.\r\n\r\n“Oh, nurse and I were discussing things, you know,” I answered, “and she\r\nsaid you could have done without me.” Somehow, I did not mind repeating\r\nthe words now; clearly it could have been but Mrs. Fursey's fun.\r\n\r\nMy mother drew me closer to her.\r\n\r\n“And what made her think that?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you see,” I replied, “I came at a very awkward time, didn't I;\r\nwhen you had a lot of other troubles.”\r\n\r\nMy mother laughed, but the next moment looked grave again.\r\n\r\n“I did not know you thought about such things,” she said; “we must be\r\nmore together, you and I, Paul, and you shall tell me all you think,\r\nbecause nurse does not quite understand you. It is true what she said\r\nabout the trouble; it came just at that time. But I could not have done\r\nwithout you. I was very unhappy, and you were sent to comfort me and\r\nhelp me to bear it.” I liked this explanation better.\r\n\r\n“Then it was lucky, your having me?” I said. Again my mother laughed,\r\nand again there followed that graver look upon her childish face.\r\n\r\n“Will you remember what I am going to say?” She spoke so earnestly that\r\nI, wriggling into a sitting posture, became earnest also.\r\n\r\n“I'll try,” I answered; “but I ain't got a very good memory, have I?”\r\n\r\n“Not very,” smiled my mother; “but if you think about it a good deal it\r\nwill not leave you. When you are a good boy, and later on, when you are\r\na good man, then I am the luckiest little mother in all the world. And\r\nevery time you fail, that means bad luck for me. You will remember that\r\nafter I'm gone, when you are a big man, won't you, Paul?”\r\n\r\nSo, both of us quite serious, I promised; and though I smile now when\r\nI remember, seeing before me those two earnest, childish faces, yet I\r\nthink, however little success it may be I have to boast of, it would\r\nperhaps have been still less had I entirely forgotten.\r\n\r\nFrom that day my mother waxes in my memory; Mrs. Fursey, of the many\r\npromontories, waning. There were sunny mornings in the neglected garden,\r\nwhere the leaves played round us while we worked and read; twilight\r\nevenings in the window seat where, half hidden by the dark red curtains,\r\nwe would talk in whispers, why I know not, of good men and noble women,\r\nogres, fairies, saints and demons; they were pleasant days.\r\n\r\nPossibly our curriculum lacked method; maybe it was too varied and\r\nextensive for my age, in consequence of which chronology became confused\r\nwithin my brain, and fact and fiction more confounded than has usually\r\nbeen considered permissible, even in history. I saw Aphrodite, ready\r\narmed and risen from the sea, move with stately grace to meet King\r\nCanute, who, throned upon the sand, bade her come no further lest\r\nshe should wet his feet. In forest glade I saw King Rufus fall from a\r\npoisoned arrow shot by Robin Hood; but thanks to sweet Queen Eleanor,\r\nwho sucked the poison from his wound, I knew he lived. Oliver Cromwell,\r\nhaving killed King Charles, married his widow, and was in turn stabbed\r\nby Hamlet. Ulysses, in the Argo, it was fixed upon my mind, had\r\ndiscovered America. Romulus and Remus had slain the wolf and rescued\r\nLittle Red Riding Hood. Good King Arthur, for letting the cakes burn,\r\nhad been murdered by his uncle in the Tower of London. Prometheus, bound\r\nto the Rock, had been saved by good St. George. Paris had given the\r\napple to William Tell. What matter! the information was there. It needed\r\nrearranging, that was all.\r\n\r\nSometimes, of an afternoon, we would climb the steep winding pathway\r\nthrough the woods, past awful precipices, spirit-haunted, by grassy\r\nswards where fairies danced o' nights, by briar and bracken sheltered\r\nCaves where fearsome creatures lurked, till high above the creeping sea\r\nwe would reach the open plateau where rose old Jacob's ruined tower.\r\n“Jacob's Folly” it was more often called about the country side, and by\r\nsome “The Devil's Tower;” for legend had it that there old Jacob and his\r\nmaster, the Devil, had often met in windy weather to wave false wrecking\r\nlights to troubled ships. Who “old Jacob” was, I never, that I can\r\nremember, learned, nor how nor why he built the Tower. Certain only it\r\nis his memory was unpopular, and the fisher folk would swear that\r\nstill on stormy nights strange lights would gleam and flash from the\r\nivy-curtained windows of his Folly.\r\n\r\nBut in day time no spot was more inviting, the short moss-grass before\r\nits shattered door, the lichen on its crumbling stones. From its topmost\r\nplatform one saw the distant mountains, faint like spectres, and the\r\nsilent ships that came and vanished; and about one's feet the pleasant\r\nfarm lands and the grave, sweet river.\r\n\r\n", " that\r\nstill on stormy nights strange lights would gleam and flash from the\r\nivy-curtained windows of his Folly.\r\n\r\nBut in day time no spot was more inviting, the short moss-grass before\r\nits shattered door, the lichen on its crumbling stones. From its topmost\r\nplatform one saw the distant mountains, faint like spectres, and the\r\nsilent ships that came and vanished; and about one's feet the pleasant\r\nfarm lands and the grave, sweet river.\r\n\r\nSmaller and poorer the world has grown since then. Now, behind those\r\nhills lie naught but smoky towns and dingy villages; but then they\r\nscreened a land of wonder where princesses dwelt in castles, where the\r\ncities were of gold. Now the ocean is but six days' journey wide, ending\r\nat the New York Custom House. Then, had one set one's sail upon it, one\r\nwould have travelled far and far, beyond the golden moonlight, beyond\r\nthe gate of clouds; to the magic land of the blood red shore, t'other\r\nside o' the sun. I never dreamt in those days a world could be so small.\r\n\r\nUpon the topmost platform a wooden seat ran round within the parapet,\r\nand sitting there hand in hand, sheltered from the wind which ever blew\r\nabout the tower, my mother would people for me all the earth and air\r\nwith the forms of myth and legend--perhaps unwisely, yet I do not\r\nknow. I took no harm from it, good rather, I think. They were beautiful\r\nfancies, most of them; or so my mother turned them, making for love and\r\npity, as do all the tales that live, whether poems or old wives fables.\r\nBut at that time of course they had no meaning for me other than the\r\nliteral; so that my mother, looking into my eyes, would often hasten\r\nto add: “But that, you know, is only an old superstition, and of course\r\nthere are no such things nowadays.” Yet, forgetful sometimes of the\r\ntime, and overtaken homeward by the shadows, we would hasten swiftly\r\nthrough the darkening path, holding each other tightly by the hand.\r\n\r\nSpring had waxed to summer, summer waned to autumn. Then my aunt and I\r\none morning, waiting at the breakfast table, saw through the open window\r\nmy mother skipping, dancing, pirouetting up the garden path. She held\r\na letter open in her hand, which as she drew near she waved about her\r\nhead, singing:\r\n\r\n“Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, then comes Wednesday morning.”\r\n\r\nShe caught me to her and began dancing with me round the room.\r\n\r\nObserved my aunt, who continued steadily to eat bread and butter:\r\n\r\n“Just like 'em all. Goes mad with joy. What for? Because she's going to\r\nleave a decent house, to live in a poky hole in the East End of London,\r\nand keep one servant.”\r\n\r\nTo my aunt the second person ever remained a grammatical superfluity.\r\nInvariably she spoke not to but of a person, throwing out her\r\nconversation in the form of commentary. This had the advantage\r\nof permitting the party intended to ignore it as mere impersonal\r\nphilosophy. Seeing it was generally uncomplimentary, most people\r\npreferred so to regard it; but my mother had never succeeded in\r\nschooling herself to indifference.\r\n\r\n“It's not a poky hole,” she replied; “it's an old-fashioned house, near\r\nthe river.”\r\n\r\n“Plaistow marshes!” ejaculated my aunt, “calls it the river!”\r\n\r\n“So it is the river,” returned my mother; “the river is the other side\r\nof the marshes.”\r\n\r\n“Let's hope it will always stop there,” said my aunt.\r\n\r\n“And it's got a garden,” continued my mother, ignoring my aunt's last\r\nremark; “which is quite an unusual feature in a London house. And it\r\nisn't the East End of London; it is a rising suburb. And you won't make\r\nme miserable because I am too happy.”\r\n\r\n“Drat the woman!” said my aunt, “why can't she sit down and give us our\r\ntea before it's all cold?”\r\n\r\n“You are a disagreeable thing!” said my mother.\r\n\r\n“Not half milk,” said my aunt. My aunt was never in the least disturbed\r\nby other people's opinion of her, which was perhaps well for her.\r\n\r\nFor three days my mother packed and sang; and a dozen times a day\r\nunpacked and laughed, looking for things wanted that were always found\r\nat the very bottom of the very last box looked into, so that Anna,\r\nwaiting for a certain undergarment of my aunt's which shall be nameless,\r\nsuggested a saving of time:\r\n\r\n“If I were you, ma'am,” said Anna, “I'd look into the last box you're\r\ngoing to look into first.”\r\n\r\nBut it was found eventually in the first box-the box, that is, my mother\r\nhad intended to search first, but which, acting on Anna's suggestion,\r\nshe had reserved till the last. This caused my mother to be quite short\r\nwith Anna, who she said had wasted her time. But by Tuesday afternoon\r\nall stood ready: we were to start early Wednesday morning.\r\n\r\nThat evening, missing my mother in the house, I sought her in the garden\r\nand found her, as I had expected, on her favourite seat under the great\r\nlime tree; but to my surprise there were tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“But I thought you were glad we were going,” I said.\r\n\r\n“So I am,” answered my mother, drying her eyes only to make room for\r\nfresh tears.\r\n\r\n“Then why are you crying?”\r\n\r\n“Because I'm sorry to leave here.”\r\n\r\nGrown-up folks with their contradictory ways were a continual puzzle to\r\nme in those days; I am not sure I quite understand them even now, myself\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\nWe were up and off next day before the dawn. The sun rose as the wagon\r\nreached the top of the hill; and there we paused and took our farewell\r\nlook at Old Jacob's Tower. My mother cried a little behind her veil; but\r\nmy aunt only said, “I never did care for earwigs in my tea;” and as\r\nfor myself I was too excited and expectant to feel much sentiment about\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nOn the journey I sat next to an exceptionally large and heavy man, who\r\nin his sleep--and he slept often--imagined me to be a piece of stuffing\r\nout of place. Then, grunting and wriggling, he would endeavour to rub\r\nme out, until the continued irritation of my head between the window\r\nand his back would cause him to awake, when he would look down upon me\r\nreprovingly but not unkindly, observing to the carriage generally: “It's\r\na funny thing, ain't it, nobody's ever made a boy yet that could keep\r\nstill for ten seconds.” After which he would pat me heartily on the\r\nhead, to show he was not vexed with me, and fall to sleep again upon me.\r\nHe was a good-tempered man.\r\n\r\nMy mother sat occupied chiefly with her own thoughts, and my aunt had\r\nfound a congenial companion in a lady who had had her cap basket sat\r\nupon; so I was left mainly to my own resources. When I could get my head\r\nfree of the big man's back, I gazed out of the window, and watched the\r\nflying fragments as we shed the world. Now a village would fall from us,\r\nnow the yellow corn-land would cling to us for awhile, or a wood catch\r\nat our rushing feet, and sometimes a strong town would stop us, and hold\r\nus, panting for a space. Or, my eyes weary, I would sit and listen to\r\nthe hoarse singing of the wheels beneath my feet. It was a monotonous\r\nchaunt, ever the same two lines:\r\n\r\n     “Here we suffer grief and pain,\r\n     Here we meet to part again,”\r\n\r\nfollowed by a low, rumbling laugh. Sometimes fortissimo, sometimes\r\npianissimo; now vivace, now largo; but ever those same two lines, and\r\never followed by the same low, rumbling laugh; still to this day the\r\niron wheels sing to me that same song.\r\n\r\nLater on I also must have slept, for I dreamt that as the result of my\r\nhaving engaged in single combat with a dragon, the dragon, ignoring all\r\nthe rules of Fairy", " by a low, rumbling laugh. Sometimes fortissimo, sometimes\r\npianissimo; now vivace, now largo; but ever those same two lines, and\r\never followed by the same low, rumbling laugh; still to this day the\r\niron wheels sing to me that same song.\r\n\r\nLater on I also must have slept, for I dreamt that as the result of my\r\nhaving engaged in single combat with a dragon, the dragon, ignoring all\r\nthe rules of Fairyland, had swallowed me. It was hot and stuffy in the\r\ndragon's stomach. He had, so it appeared to me, disgracefully overeaten\r\nhimself; there were hundreds of us there, entirely undigested, including\r\nMother Hubbard and a gentleman named Johnson, against whom, at that\r\nperiod, I entertained a strong prejudice by reason of our divergent\r\nviews upon the subject of spelling. Even in this hour of our mutual\r\ndiscomfort Johnson would not leave me alone, but persisted in asking me\r\nhow I spelt Jonah. Nobody was looking, so I kicked him. He sprang up\r\nand came after me. I tried to run away, but became wedged between\r\nHop-o'-my-Thumb and Julius Caesar. I suppose our tearing about must\r\nhave hurt the dragon, for at that moment he gave vent to a most fearful\r\nscream, and I awoke to find the fat man rubbing his left shin, while\r\nwe struggled slowly, with steps growing ever feebler, against a sea of\r\nbrick that every moment closed in closer round us.\r\n\r\nWe scrambled out of the carriage into a great echoing cave that\r\nmight have been the dragon's home, where, to my alarm, my mother was\r\nimmediately swooped down upon by a strange man in grey.\r\n\r\n“Why's he do that?” I asked of my aunt.\r\n\r\n“Because he's a fool,” answered my aunt; “they all are.”\r\n\r\nHe put my mother down and came towards us. He was a tall, thin man, with\r\neyes one felt one would never be afraid of; and instinctively even then\r\nI associated him in my mind with windmills and a lank white horse.\r\n\r\n“Why, how he's grown,” said the grey man, raising me in his arms until\r\nmy mother beside me appeared to me in a new light as quite a little\r\nperson; “and solid too.”\r\n\r\nMy mother whispered something. I think from her face, for I knew the\r\nsigns, it was praise of me.\r\n\r\n“And he's going to be our new fortune,” she added aloud, as the grey man\r\nlowered me.\r\n\r\n“Then,” said my aunt, who had this while been sitting rigid upon a flat\r\nblack box, “don't drop him down a coal-mine. That's all I say.”\r\n\r\nI wondered at the time why the grey man's pale face should flush so\r\ncrimson, and why my mother should whisper angrily:\r\n\r\n“How can you be so wicked, Fanny? How dare you say such a thing?”\r\n\r\n“I only said 'don't drop him down a coal-mine,'” returned my aunt,\r\napparently much surprised; “you don't want to drop him down a coal-mine,\r\ndo you?”\r\n\r\nWe passed through glittering, joyous streets, piled high each side with\r\nall the good things of the earth; toys and baubles, jewels and gold,\r\nthings good to eat and good to drink, things good to wear and good to\r\nsee; through pleasant ways where fountains splashed and flowers bloomed.\r\nThe people wore bright clothes, had happy faces. They rode in beautiful\r\ncarriages, they strolled about, greeting one another with smiles. The\r\nchildren ran and laughed. London, thought I to myself, is the city of\r\nthe fairies.\r\n\r\nIt passed, and we sank into a grim city of hoarse, roaring streets,\r\nwherein the endless throngs swirled and surged as I had seen the yellow\r\nwaters curve and fret, contending, where the river pauses, rock-bound.\r\nHere were no bright costumes, no bright faces, none stayed to greet\r\nanother; all was stern, and swift, and voiceless. London, then, said I\r\nto myself, is the city of the giants. They must live in these towering\r\ncastles side by side, and these hurrying thousands are their driven\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nBut this passed also, and we sank lower yet until we reached a third\r\ncity, where a pale mist filled each sombre street. None of the beautiful\r\nthings of the world were to be seen here, but only the things coarse\r\nand ugly. And wearily to and fro its sunless passages trudged with heavy\r\nsteps a weary people, coarse-clad, and with dull, listless faces. And\r\nLondon, I knew, was the city of the gnomes who labour sadly all their\r\nlives, imprisoned underground; and a terror seized me lest I, too,\r\nshould remain chained here, deep down below the fairy city that was\r\nalready but a dream.\r\n\r\nWe stopped at last in a long, unfinished street. I remember our pushing\r\nour way through a group of dirty urchins, all of whom, my aunt remarked\r\nin passing, ought to be skinned. It was my aunt's one prescription for\r\nall to whom she took objection; but really in the present instance I\r\nthink it would have been of service; nothing else whatever could have\r\nrestored them to cleanliness. Then the door closed behind us with an\r\nechoing clang, and the small, cold rooms came forward stiffly to greet\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe man in grey went to the one window and drew back the curtain; it\r\nwas growing dusk now. My aunt sat on a straight, hard chair and stared\r\nfixedly at the three-armed gaselier. My mother stood in the centre of\r\nthe room with one small ungloved hand upon the table, and I noticed--for\r\nI was very near--that the poor little one-legged thing was trembling.\r\n\r\n“Of course it's not what you've been accustomed to, Maggie,” said the\r\nman in grey; “but it's only for a little while.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a new, angry voice; but I could not see his face, his back\r\nbeing to the light.\r\n\r\nMy mother drew his arms around us both.\r\n\r\n“It is the best home in all the world,” she said; and thus we stayed for\r\nawhile.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” said my aunt, suddenly; and this aroused us; “it's a poky\r\nhole, as I told her it would be. Let her thank the Lord she's got a\r\nman clever enough to get her out of it. I know him; he never could rest\r\nwhere he was put. Now he's at the bottom; he'll go up.”\r\n\r\nIt sounded to me a very disagreeable speech; but the grey man laughed--I\r\nhad not heard him laugh till then--and my mother ran to my aunt and\r\nkissed her; and somehow the room seemed to become lighter.\r\n\r\nFor some reason I slept downstairs that night, on the floor, behind a\r\nscreen improvised out of a clothes horse and a blanket; and later in the\r\nevening the clatter of knives and forks and the sound of subdued voices\r\nawoke me. My aunt had apparently gone to bed; my mother and the man in\r\ngrey were talking together over their supper.\r\n\r\n“We must buy land,” said the voice of the grey man; “London is coming\r\nthis way. The Somebodies” (I forget the name my father mentioned) “made\r\nall their money by buying up land round New York for a mere song. Then,\r\nas the city spread, they became worth millions.”\r\n\r\n“But where will you get the money from, Luke?” asked the voice of my\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the grey man answered airily:\r\n\r\n“Oh, that's merely a matter of business. You grant a mortgage. The\r\nproperty goes up in value. You borrow more. Then you buy more--and so\r\non.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said my mother.\r\n\r\n“Being on the spot gives one such an advantage,” said the grey man. “I\r\nshall know just when to buy. It's a great thing, being on the spot.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, it must be,” said my mother.\r\n\r\nI suppose I must have dozed, for the next words I heard the grey man say\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n“Of course you have the park opposite, but then the house is small.”\r\n\r\n“But shall we need a very large one?” asked my mother.\r\n\r\n“One never knows,” said the grey man. “If I", " grey man. “I\r\nshall know just when to buy. It's a great thing, being on the spot.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, it must be,” said my mother.\r\n\r\nI suppose I must have dozed, for the next words I heard the grey man say\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n“Of course you have the park opposite, but then the house is small.”\r\n\r\n“But shall we need a very large one?” asked my mother.\r\n\r\n“One never knows,” said the grey man. “If I should go into Parliament--”\r\n\r\nAt this point a hissing sound arose from the neighbourhood of the fire.\r\n\r\n“It _looks_,” said my mother, “as if it were done.”\r\n\r\n“If you will hold the dish,” said the grey man, “I think I can pour it\r\nin without spilling.”\r\n\r\nAgain I must have dozed.\r\n\r\n“It depends,” said the grey man, “upon what he is going to be. For the\r\nclassics, of course, Oxford.”\r\n\r\n“He's going to be very clever,” said my mother. She spoke as one who\r\nknows.\r\n\r\n“We'll hope so,” said the grey man.\r\n\r\n“I shouldn't be surprised,” said my mother, “if he turned out a poet.”\r\n\r\nThe grey man said something in a low tone that I did not hear.\r\n\r\n“I'm not so sure,” answered my mother, “it's in the blood. I've often\r\nthought that you, Luke, ought to have been a poet.”\r\n\r\n“I never had the time,” said the grey man. “There were one or two little\r\nthings--”\r\n\r\n“They were very beautiful,” interrupted my mother. The clatter of the\r\nknives and forks continued undisturbed for a few moments. Then continued\r\nthe grey man:\r\n\r\n“There would be no harm, provided I made enough. It's the law of nature.\r\nOne generation earns, the next spends. We must see. In any case, I think\r\nI should prefer Oxford for him.”\r\n\r\n“It will be so hard parting from him,” said my mother.\r\n\r\n“There will be the vacations,” said the grey man, “when we shall\r\ntravel.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nIN WHICH PAUL MAKES ACQUAINTANCE OF THE MAN WITH THE UGLY MOUTH.\r\n\r\nThe case of my father and mother was not normal. You understand they\r\nhad been separated for some years, and though they were not young in\r\nage--indeed, before my childish eyes they loomed quite ancient folk,\r\nand in fact my father must have been nearly forty and my mother quit of\r\nthirty--yet, as you will come to think yourself, no doubt, during the\r\ncourse of my story, they were in all the essentials of life little more\r\nthan boy and girl. This I came to see later on, but at that time, had I\r\nbeen consulted by enquiring maid or bachelor, I might unwittingly have\r\ngiven wrong impressions concerning marriage in the general. I should\r\nhave described a husband as a man who could never rest quite content\r\nunless his wife were by his side; who twenty times a day would call from\r\nhis office door: “Maggie, are you doing anything important? I want to\r\ntalk to you about a matter of business.” ... “Maggie, are you alone? Oh,\r\nall right, I'll come down.” Of a wife I should have said she was a woman\r\nwhose eyes were ever love-lit when resting on her man; who was glad\r\nwhere he was and troubled where he was not. But in every case this might\r\nnot have been correct.\r\n\r\nAlso, I should have had something to say concerning the alarms and\r\nexcursions attending residence with any married couple. I should have\r\nrecommended the holding up of feet under the table lest, mistaken for\r\nother feet, they should be trodden on and pressed. Also, I should have\r\nadvised against entry into any room unpreceded by what in Stageland\r\nis termed “noise without.” It is somewhat disconcerting to the nervous\r\nincomer to be met, the door still in his hand, by a sound as of people\r\nspringing suddenly into the air, followed by a weird scuttling of feet,\r\nand then to discover the occupants sitting stiffly in opposite corners,\r\ndeeply engaged in book or needlework. But, as I have said, with regard\r\nto some households, such precautions might be needless.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I fear, I exercised little or no controlling influence upon\r\nmy parents in this respect, my intrusions coming soon to be greeted\r\nwith: “Oh, it's only Spud,” in a tone of relief, accompanied generally\r\nby the sofa cushion; but of my aunt they stood more in awe. Not that she\r\never said anything, and, indeed, to do her justice, in her efforts to\r\nspare their feelings she erred, if at all, on the side of excess.\r\nNever did she move a footstep about the house except to the music of\r\na sustained and penetrating cough. As my father once remarked,\r\nungratefully, I must confess, the volume of bark produced by my aunt in\r\na single day would have done credit to the dying efforts of a hospital\r\nload of consumptives; to a robust and perfectly healthy lady the cost in\r\nnervous force must have been prodigious. Also, that no fear should live\r\nwith them that her eyes had seen aught not intended for them, she would\r\ninvariably enter backwards any room in which they might be, closing the\r\ndoor loudly and with difficulty before turning round: and through dark\r\npassages she would walk singing. No woman alive could have done more;\r\nyet--such is human nature!--neither my father nor my mother was grateful\r\nto her, so far as I could judge.\r\n\r\nIndeed, strange as it may appear, the more sympathetic towards them she\r\nshowed herself, the more irritated against her did they become.\r\n\r\n“I believe, Fanny, you hate seeing Luke and me happy together,” said my\r\nmother one day, coming up from the kitchen to find my aunt preparing\r\nfor entry into the drawing-room by dropping teaspoons at five-second\r\nintervals outside the door: “Don't make yourself so ridiculous.” My\r\nmother spoke really quite unkindly.\r\n\r\n“Hate it!” replied my aunt. “Why should I? Why shouldn't a pair of\r\nturtle doves bill and coo, when their united age is only a little over\r\nseventy, the pretty dears?” The mildness of my aunt's answers often\r\nsurprised me.\r\n\r\nAs for my father, he grew positively vindictive. I remember the occasion\r\nwell. It was the first, though not the last time I knew him lose his\r\ntemper. What brought up the subject I forget, but my father stopped\r\nsuddenly; we were walking by the canal bank.\r\n\r\n“Your aunt”--my father may not have intended it, but his tone and manner\r\nwhen speaking of my aunt always conveyed to me the impression that he\r\nregarded me as personally responsible for her existence. This used to\r\nweigh upon me. “Your aunt is the most cantankerous, the most--” he broke\r\noff, and shook his fist towards the setting sun. “I wish to God,” said\r\nmy father, “your aunt had a comfortable little income of her own, with\r\na freehold cottage in the country, by God I do!” But the next moment,\r\nashamed, I suppose, of his brutality: “Not but what sometimes, of\r\ncourse, she can be very nice, you know,” he added; “don't tell your\r\nmother what I said just now.”\r\n\r\nAnother who followed with sympathetic interest the domestic comedy was\r\nSusan, our maid-of-all-work, the first of a long and varied series,\r\nextending unto the advent of Amy, to whom the blessing of Heaven. Susan\r\nwas a stout and elderly female, liable to sudden fits of sleepiness, the\r\nresult, we were given to understand, of trouble; but her heart, it was\r\nher own proud boast, was always in the right place. She could never look\r\nat my father and mother sitting anywhere near each other but she must\r\nflop down and weep awhile; the sight of connubial bliss always reminding\r\nher, so she would explain, of the past glories of her own married state.\r\n\r\nThough an earnest enquirer, I was never able myself to grasp the ins\r\nand outs of this past married life of Susan's. Whether her answers were\r\npurposely framed to elude curiosity, or whether they were the result of\r\na naturally incoherent mind, I cannot say. Their tendency was to", "flop down and weep awhile; the sight of connubial bliss always reminding\r\nher, so she would explain, of the past glories of her own married state.\r\n\r\nThough an earnest enquirer, I was never able myself to grasp the ins\r\nand outs of this past married life of Susan's. Whether her answers were\r\npurposely framed to elude curiosity, or whether they were the result of\r\na naturally incoherent mind, I cannot say. Their tendency was to convey\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nOn Monday I have seen Susan shed tears of regret into the Brussels\r\nsprouts, that she had been debarred by the pressure of other duties from\r\nlately watering “his” grave, which, I gathered, was at Manor Park.\r\nWhile on Tuesday I have listened, blood chilled, to the recital of her\r\nintentions should she ever again enjoy the luxury of getting her fingers\r\nnear the scruff of his neck.\r\n\r\n“But, I thought, Susan, he was dead,” was my very natural comment upon\r\nthis outbreak.\r\n\r\n“So did I, Master Paul,” was Susan's rejoinder; “that was his\r\nartfulness.”\r\n\r\n“Then he isn't buried in Manor Park Cemetery?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet; but he'll wish he was, the half-baked monkey, when I get hold\r\nof him.”\r\n\r\n“Then he wasn't a good man?”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“Your husband.”\r\n\r\n“Who says he ain't a good man?” It was Susan's flying leaps from tense\r\nto tense that most bewildered me. “If anybody says he ain't I'll gouge\r\ntheir eye out!”\r\n\r\nI hastened to assure Susan that my observation had been intended in the\r\nnature of enquiry, not of assertion.\r\n\r\n“Brings me a bottle of gin--for my headaches--every time he comes home,”\r\n continued Susan, showing cause for opinion, “every blessed time.”\r\n\r\nAnd at some such point as this I would retire to the clearer atmosphere\r\nof German grammar or mixed fractions.\r\n\r\nWe suffered a good deal from Susan one way and another; for having\r\nregard to the admirable position of her heart, we all felt it our duty\r\nto overlook mere failings of the flesh--all but my aunt, that is, who\r\nnever made any pretence of being a sentimentalist.\r\n\r\n“She's a lazy hussy,” was the opinion expressed of her one morning by my\r\naunt, who was rinsing; “a gulping, snorting, lazy hussy, that's what she\r\nis.” There was some excuse for my aunt's indignation. It was then eleven\r\no'clock and Susan was still sleeping off an attack of what she called\r\n“new-ralgy.”\r\n\r\n“She has seen a good deal of trouble,” said my mother, who was wiping.\r\n\r\n“And if she was my cook and housemaid,” replied my aunt, “she would see\r\nmore, the slut!”\r\n\r\n“She's not a good servant in many respects,” admitted my mother, “but I\r\nthink she's good-hearted.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, drat her heart,” was my aunt's retort. “The right place for that\r\nheart of hers is on the doorstep. And that's where I'd put it, and her\r\nand her box alongside it, if I had my way.”\r\n\r\nThe departure of Susan did take place not long afterwards. It occurred\r\none Saturday night. My mother came upstairs looking pale.\r\n\r\n“Luke,” she said, “do please run for the doctor.”\r\n\r\n“What's the matter?” asked my father.\r\n\r\n“Susan,” gasped my mother, “she's lying on the kitchen floor breathing\r\nin the strangest fashion and quite unable to speak.”\r\n\r\n“I'll go for Washburn,” said my father; “if I am quick I shall catch him\r\nat the dispensary.”\r\n\r\nFive minutes later my father came back panting, followed by the doctor.\r\nThis was a big, black-bearded man; added to which he had the knack of\r\nlooking bigger than even he really was. He came down the kitchen stairs\r\ntwo at a time, shaking the whole house. He brushed my mother aside, and\r\nbent over the unconscious Susan, who was on her back with her mouth wide\r\nopen. Then he rose and looked at my father and mother, who were watching\r\nhim with troubled faces; and then he opened his mouth, and there came\r\nfrom it a roar of laughter, the like of which sound I had never heard.\r\n\r\nThe next moment he had seized a pail half full of water and had flung it\r\nover the woman. She opened her eyes and sat up.\r\n\r\n“Feeling better?” said the doctor, with the pail still in his hand;\r\n“have another dose?”\r\n\r\nSusan began to gather herself together with the evident intention of\r\nexpressing her feelings; but before she could find the first word, he\r\nhad pushed the three of us outside and slammed the door behind us.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of the stairs we could hear Susan's thick, rancorous voice\r\nraging fiercer and fiercer, drowned every now and then by the man's\r\nsavage roar of laughter. And, when for want of breath she would flag for\r\na moment, he would yell out encouragement to her, shouting: “Bravo!\r\nGo it, my beauty, give it tongue! Bark, bark! I love to hear you,”\r\n applauding her, clapping his hands and stamping his feet.\r\n\r\n“What a beast of a man,” said my mother.\r\n\r\n“He is really a most interesting man when you come to know him,”\r\n explained my father.\r\n\r\nReplied my mother, stiffly: “I don't ever mean to know him.” But it is\r\nonly concerning the past that we possess knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe riot from below ceased at length, and was followed by a new voice,\r\nspeaking quietly and emphatically, and then we heard the doctor's step\r\nagain upon the stairs.\r\n\r\nMy mother held her purse open in her hand, and as the man entered the\r\nroom she went forward to meet him.\r\n\r\n“How much do we owe you, Doctor?” said my mother. She spoke in a voice\r\ntrembling with severity.\r\n\r\nHe closed the purse and gently pushed it back towards her.\r\n\r\n“A glass of beer and a chop, Mrs. Kelver,” he answered, “which I am\r\ncoming back in an hour to cook for myself. And as you will be without\r\nany servant,” he continued, while my mother stood staring at him\r\nincapable of utterance, “you had better let me cook some for you at the\r\nsame time. I am an expert at grilling chops.”\r\n\r\n“But, really, Doctor--” my mother began. He laid his huge hand upon her\r\nshoulder, and my mother sat down upon the nearest chair.\r\n\r\n“My dear lady,” he said, “she's a person you never ought to have had\r\ninside your house. She's promised me to be gone in half an hour, and\r\nI'm coming back to see she keeps her word. Give her a month's wages, and\r\nhave a clear fire ready for me.” And before my mother could reply, he\r\nhad slammed the front door.\r\n\r\n“What a very odd sort of a man,” said my mother, recovering herself.\r\n\r\n“He's a character,” said my father; “you might not think it, but he's\r\nworshipped about here.”\r\n\r\n“I hardly know what to make of him,” said my mother; “I suppose I had\r\nbetter go out and get some chops;” which she did.\r\n\r\nSusan went, as sober as a judge on Friday, as the saying is, her great\r\nanxiety being to get out of the house before the doctor returned. The\r\ndoctor himself arrived true to his time, and I lay awake--for no human\r\nbeing ever slept or felt he wanted to sleep while Dr. Washburn was\r\nanywhere near--and listened to the gusts of laughter that swept\r\ncontinually through the house. Even my aunt laughed that supper time,\r\nand when the doctor himself laughed it seemed to me that the bed shook\r\nunder me. Not liking to be out of it, I did what spoilt little boys\r\nand even spoilt little girls sometimes will do under similar stress of\r\nfeeling, wrapped the blanket round my legs and pattered down, with\r\nmy face set to express the sudden desire of a sensitive and possibly\r\nshort-lived child for parents' love. My mother pretended to be angry,\r\nbut that I knew was only her company manners. Besides, I really had, if\r\nnot exactly a pain, an extremely uncomfortable sensation (one common to\r\nme about that period) as of having swallowed the dome of St. Paul's. The\r\ndoctor", " stress of\r\nfeeling, wrapped the blanket round my legs and pattered down, with\r\nmy face set to express the sudden desire of a sensitive and possibly\r\nshort-lived child for parents' love. My mother pretended to be angry,\r\nbut that I knew was only her company manners. Besides, I really had, if\r\nnot exactly a pain, an extremely uncomfortable sensation (one common to\r\nme about that period) as of having swallowed the dome of St. Paul's. The\r\ndoctor said it was a frequent complaint with children, the result of too\r\nearly hours and too much study; and, taking me on his knee, wrote then\r\nand there a diet chart for me, which included one tablespoonful of\r\ngolden syrup four times a day, and one ounce of sherbet to be placed\r\nupon the tongue and taken neat ten minutes before each meal.\r\n\r\nThat evening will always live in my remembrance. My mother was brighter\r\nthan I had ever seen her. A flush was on her cheek and a sparkle in her\r\neye, and looking across at her as she sat holding a small painted screen\r\nto shield her face from the fire, the sense of beauty became suddenly\r\nborn within me, and answering an impulse I could not have explained, I\r\nslipped down, still with my blanket around me, from the doctor's knee,\r\nand squatted on the edge of the fender, from where, when I thought no\r\none was noticing me, I could steal furtive glances up into her face.\r\n\r\nSo also my father seemed to me to have become all at once bigger and\r\nmore dignified, talking with a vigour and an enjoyment that sat newly on\r\nhim. Aunt Fan was quite witty and agreeable--for her; and even I asked\r\none or two questions, at which, for some reason or another, everybody\r\nlaughed; which determined me to remember and ask those same questions\r\nagain on some future occasion.\r\n\r\nThat was the great charm of the man, that by the magnetic spell of his\r\nmagnificent vitality he drew from everyone their best. In his company\r\nclever people waxed intellectual giants, while the dull sat amazed at\r\ntheir own originality. Conversing with him, Podsnap might have been\r\npiquant, Dogberry incisive. But better than all else, I found it\r\nlistening to his own talk. Of what he spoke I could tell you no more\r\nthan could the children of Hamelin have told the tune the Pied Piper\r\nplayed. I only know that at the tangled music of his strong voice\r\nthe walls of the mean room faded away, and that beyond I saw a brave,\r\nlaughing world that called to me; a world full of joyous fight, where\r\nsome won and some lost. But that mattered not a jot, because whatever\r\nelse came of it there was a right royal game for all; a world where\r\nmerry gentlemen feared neither life nor death, and Fate was but the\r\nMaster of the Revels.\r\n\r\nSuch was my first introduction to Dr. Washburn, or to give him the\r\nname by which he was known in every slum and alley of that quarter, Dr.\r\nFighting Hal; and in a minor key that evening was an index to the whole\r\nman. Often he would wrinkle his nose as a dog before it bites, and then\r\nhe was more brute than man--brutish in his instincts, in his appetites,\r\nbrutish in his pleasure, brutish in his fun. Or his deep blue eyes would\r\ngrow soft as a mother's, and then you might have thought him an angel\r\nin a soft felt hat and a coat so loose-fitting as to suggest the\r\npossibility of his wings being folded away underneath. Often have I\r\ntried to make up my mind whether it has been better for me or worse that\r\nI ever came to know him; but as easy would it be for the tree to\r\nsay whether the rushing winds and the wild rains have shaped it or\r\nmis-shaped.\r\n\r\nSusan's place remained vacant for some time. My mother would explain\r\nto the few friends who occasionally came from afar to see us, that her\r\n“housemaid” she had been compelled to suddenly discharge, and that\r\nwe were waiting for the arrival of a new and better specimen. But the\r\nmonths passed and we still waited, and my father on the rare days when\r\na client would ring the office bell, would, after pausing a decent\r\ninterval, open the front door himself, and then call downstairs\r\nindignantly and loudly, to know why “Jane” or “Mary” could not attend to\r\ntheir work. And my mother, that the bread-boy or the milkman might not\r\nput it about the neighbourhood that the Kelvers in the big corner house\r\nkept no servant, would hide herself behind a thick veil and fetch all\r\nthings herself from streets a long way off.\r\n\r\nFor this family of whom I am writing were, I confess, weak and human.\r\nTheir poverty they were ashamed of as though it were a crime, and in\r\nconsequence their life was more full of paltry and useless subterfuge\r\nthan should be perhaps the life of brave men and women. The larder,\r\nI fancy, was very often bare, but the port and sherry with the sweet\r\nbiscuits stood always on the sideboard; and the fire had often to be low\r\nin the grate that my father's tall hat might shine resplendent and my\r\nmother's black silk rustle on Sundays.\r\n\r\nBut I would not have you sneer at them, thinking all pretence must\r\nspring from snobbishness and never from mistaken self-respect. Some fine\r\ngentleman writers there be--men whose world is bounded on the east by\r\nBond Street--who see in the struggles of poverty to hide its darns only\r\nmatter for jest. But myself, I cannot laugh at them. I know the long\r\nhopes and fears that centre round the hired waiter; the long cost of the\r\ncream and the ice jelly ordered the week before from the confectioner's.\r\nBut to me it is pathetic, not ridiculous. Heroism is not all of one\r\npattern. Dr. Washburn, had the Prince of Wales come to see him, would\r\nhave put his bread and cheese and jug of beer upon the table, and helped\r\nHis Royal Highness to half. But my father and mother's tea was very weak\r\nthat Mr. Jones or Mr. Smith might have a glass of wine should they come\r\nto dinner. I remember the one egg for breakfast, my mother arguing that\r\nmy father should have it because he had his business to attend to; my\r\nfather insisting that my mother should eat it, she having to go out\r\nshopping, a compromise being effected by their dividing it between them,\r\neach clamouring for the white as the most nourishing. And I know however\r\nlittle the meal looked upon the table when we started I always rose well\r\nsatisfied. These are small things to speak of, but then you must bear in\r\nmind this is a story moving in narrow ways.\r\n\r\nTo me this life came as a good time. That I was encouraged to eat\r\ntreacle in preference to butter seemed to me admirable. Personally, I\r\npreferred sausages for dinner; and a supper of fried fish and potatoes,\r\nbrought in stealthily in a carpet bag, was infinitely more enjoyable\r\nthan the set meal where nothing was of interest till one came to the\r\ndessert. What fun there was about it all! The cleaning of the doorstep\r\nby night, when from the ill-lit street a gentleman with a piece\r\nof sacking round his legs might very well pass for a somewhat tall\r\ncharwoman. I would keep watch at the gate to give warning should any\r\none looking like a possible late caller turn the corner of the street,\r\ncoming back now and then in answer to a low whistle to help my father\r\ngrope about in the dark for the hearthstone; he was always mislaying\r\nthe hearthstone. How much better, helping to clean the knives or running\r\nerrands than wasting all one's morning dwelling upon the shocking\r\nirregularity of certain classes of French verbs; or making useless\r\ncalculations as to how long X, walking four and a quarter miles an hour,\r\nwould be overtaking Y, whose powers were limited to three and a half,\r\nbut who had started two and three quarter hours sooner; the whole\r\nargument being reduced to sheer pedantry by reason of no information\r\nbeing afforded to the student concerning the respective thirstiness of X\r\nand Y.\r\n\r\nEven my father and mother were able to take it lightly with plenty of", " certain classes of French verbs; or making useless\r\ncalculations as to how long X, walking four and a quarter miles an hour,\r\nwould be overtaking Y, whose powers were limited to three and a half,\r\nbut who had started two and three quarter hours sooner; the whole\r\nargument being reduced to sheer pedantry by reason of no information\r\nbeing afforded to the student concerning the respective thirstiness of X\r\nand Y.\r\n\r\nEven my father and mother were able to take it lightly with plenty of\r\nlaughter and no groaning that I ever heard. For over all lay the morning\r\nlight of hope, and what prisoner, escaping from his dungeon, ever stayed\r\nto think of his torn hands and knees when beyond the distant opening he\r\ncould see the sunlight glinting through the brambles?\r\n\r\n“I had no idea,” said my mother, “there was so much to do in a house.\r\nIn future I shall arrange for the servants to have regular hours, and a\r\nlittle time to themselves, for rest. Don't you think it right, Luke?”\r\n\r\n“Quite right,” replied my father; “and I'll tell you another thing we'll\r\ndo. I shall insist on the landlord's putting a marble doorstep to the\r\nnext house we take; you pass a sponge over marble and it is always\r\nclean.”\r\n\r\n“Or tesselated,” suggested my mother.\r\n\r\n“Or tesselated,” agreed my father; “but marble is more uncommon.”\r\n\r\nOnly once, can I recall a cloud. That was one Sunday when my mother,\r\nspeaking across the table in the middle of dinner, said to my father,\r\n“We might save the rest of that stew, Luke; there's an omelette coming.”\r\n\r\nMy father laid down the spoon. “An omelette!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said my mother. “I thought I would like to try again.”\r\n\r\nMy father stepped into the back kitchen--we dined in the kitchen, as a\r\nrule, it saved much carriage--returning with the wood chopper.\r\n\r\n“What ever are you going to do, Luke, with the chopper?” said my mother.\r\n\r\n“Divide the omelette,” replied my father.\r\n\r\nMy mother began to cry.\r\n\r\n“Why, Maggie--!” said my father.\r\n\r\n“I know the other one was leathery,” said my mother, “but it was the\r\nfault of the oven, you know it was, Luke.”\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said my father, “I only meant it as a joke.”\r\n\r\n“I don't like that sort of joke,” said my mother; “it isn't nice of you,\r\nLuke.”\r\n\r\nI don't think, to be candid, my mother liked much any joke that was\r\nagainst herself. Indeed, when I come to think of it, I have never met a\r\nwoman who did, nor man, either.\r\n\r\nThere had soon grown up a comradeship between my father and myself for\r\nhe was the youngest thing I had met with as yet. Sometimes my mother\r\nseemed very young, and later I met boys and girls nearer to my own age\r\nin years; but they grew, while my father remained always the same. The\r\nhair about his temples was turning grey, and when you looked close you\r\nsaw many crow's feet and lines, especially about the mouth. But his eyes\r\nwere the eyes of a boy, his laugh the laugh of a boy, and his heart the\r\nheart of a boy. So we were very close to each other.\r\n\r\nIn a narrow strip of ground we called our garden we would play a cricket\r\nof our own, encompassed about by many novel rules, rendered necessary by\r\nthe locality. For instance, all hitting to leg was forbidden, as tending\r\nto endanger neighbouring windows, while hitting to off was likewise not\r\nto be encouraged, as causing a temporary adjournment of the game, while\r\nbatter and bowler went through the house and out into the street to\r\nrecover the ball from some predatory crowd of urchins to whom it had\r\nevidently appeared as a gift direct from Heaven. Sometimes rising very\r\nearly we would walk across the marshes to bathe in a small creek that\r\nled down to the river, but this was muddy work, necessitating much\r\nwashing of legs on the return home. And on rare days we would, taking\r\nthe train to Hackney and walking to the bridge, row up the river Lea,\r\nperhaps as far as Ponder's End.\r\n\r\nBut these sports being hedged around with difficulties, more commonly\r\nfor recreation we would take long walks. There were pleasant nooks even\r\nin the neighbourhood of Plaistow marshes in those days. Here and there\r\na graceful elm still clung to the troubled soil. Surrounded on all sides\r\nby hideousness, picturesque inns still remained hidden within green\r\nwalls where, if you were careful not to pry too curiously, you might\r\nsit and sip your glass of beer beneath the oak and dream yourself where\r\nreeking chimneys and mean streets were not. During such walks my father\r\nwould talk to me as he would talk to my mother, telling me all his wild,\r\nhopeful plans, discussing with me how I was to lodge at Oxford, to what\r\nparticular branches of study and of sport I was to give my preference,\r\nspeaking always with such catching confidence that I came to regard my\r\nsojourn in this brick and mortar prison as only a question of months.\r\n\r\nOne day, talking of this future, and laughing as we walked briskly,\r\nthrough the shrill streets, I told him the words my mother had\r\nsaid--long ago, as it seemed to me, for life is as a stone rolling\r\ndown-hill, and moves but slowly at first; she and I sitting on the moss\r\nat the foot of old “Jacob's Folly”--that he was our Prince fighting\r\nto deliver us from the grim castle called “Hard Times,” guarded by the\r\ndragon Poverty.\r\n\r\nMy father laughed and his boyish face flushed with pleasure.\r\n\r\n“And she was right, Paul,” he whispered, pressing my small hand in\r\nhis--it was necessary to whisper, for the street where we were was very\r\ncrowded, but I knew that he wanted to shout. “I will fight him and I\r\nwill slay him.” My father made passes in the air with his walking-stick,\r\nand it was evident from the way they drew aside that the people round\r\nabout fancied he was mad. “I will batter down the iron gates and she\r\nshall be free. I will, God help me, I will.”\r\n\r\nThe gallant gentleman! How long and how bravely he fought! But in the\r\nend it was the Dragon triumphed, the Knight that lay upon the ground,\r\nhis great heart still. I have read how, with the sword of Honest\r\nIndustry, one may always conquer this grim Dragon. But such was in\r\nfoolish books. In truth, only with the sword of Chicanery and the stout\r\nbuckler of Unscrupulousness shall you be certain of victory over him. If\r\nyou care not to use these, pray to your Gods, and take what comes with a\r\nstout heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nHOW GOOD LUCK KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE MAN IN GREY.\r\n\r\n“Louisa!” roared my father down the kitchen stairs, “are you all asleep?\r\nHere have I had to answer the front door myself.” Then my father strode\r\ninto his office, and the door slammed. My father could be very angry\r\nwhen nobody was by.\r\n\r\nQuarter of an hour later his bell rang with a quick, authoritative\r\njangle. My mother, who was peeling potatoes with difficulty in\r\nwash-leather gloves, looked at my aunt who was shelling peas. The bell\r\nrang again louder still this time.\r\n\r\n“Once for Louisa, twice for James, isn't it?” enquired my aunt.\r\n\r\n“You go, Paul,” said my mother; “say that Louisa--” but with the words a\r\nsudden flush overspread my mother's face, and before I could lay down\r\nmy slate she had drawn off her gloves and had passed me. “No, don't stop\r\nyour lessons, I'll go myself,” she said, and ran out.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the kitchen door opened softly, and my mother's\r\nhand, appearing through the jar, beckoned to me mysteriously.\r\n\r\n“Walk on your toes,” whispered my mother, setting the example as she\r\nled the way up the stairs; which after the manner of stairs showed their\r\ndisapproval of deception by creaking louder and more often than under\r\nany other circumstances; and in", "'t stop\r\nyour lessons, I'll go myself,” she said, and ran out.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the kitchen door opened softly, and my mother's\r\nhand, appearing through the jar, beckoned to me mysteriously.\r\n\r\n“Walk on your toes,” whispered my mother, setting the example as she\r\nled the way up the stairs; which after the manner of stairs showed their\r\ndisapproval of deception by creaking louder and more often than under\r\nany other circumstances; and in this manner we reached my parents'\r\nbedroom, where, in the old-fashioned wardrobe, relic of better days,\r\nreposed my best suit of clothes, or, to be strictly grammatical, my\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nNever before had I worn these on a week-day morning, but all\r\nconversation not germane to the question of getting into them quickly\r\nmy mother swept aside; and when I was complete, down even to the new\r\nshoes--Bluchers, we called them in those days--took me by the hand, and\r\ntogether we crept down as we had crept up, silent, stealthy and alert.\r\nMy mother led me to the street door and opened it.\r\n\r\n“Shan't I want my cap?” I whispered. But my mother only shook her\r\nhead and closed the door with a bang; and then the explanation of the\r\npantomime came to me, for with such “business”--comic, shall I call\r\nit, or tragic?--I was becoming familiar; and, my mother's hand upon my\r\nshoulder, we entered my father's office.\r\n\r\nWhether from the fact that so often of an evening--our drawing-room\r\nbeing reserved always as a show-room in case of chance visitors;\r\nCowper's poems, open face-downwards on the wobbly loo table; the\r\nhalf-finished crochet work, suggestive of elegant leisure, thrown\r\ncarelessly over the arm of the smaller easy-chair--this office would\r\nbecome our sitting-room, its books and papers, as things of no account,\r\nbeing huddled out of sight; or whether from the readiness with which my\r\nfather would come out of it at all times to play at something else--at\r\ncricket in the back garden on dry days or ninepins in the passage on\r\nwet, charging back into it again whenever a knock sounded at the front\r\ndoor, I cannot say. But I know that as a child it never occurred to\r\nme to regard my father's profession as a serious affair. To me he was\r\nmerely playing there, surrounded by big books and bundles of documents,\r\nlabelled profusely but consisting only of blank papers; by japanned\r\ntin boxes, lettered imposingly, but for the most part empty. “Sutton\r\nHampden, Esq.,” I remember was practically my mother's work-box. The\r\n“Drayton Estates” yielded apparently nothing but apples, a fruit of\r\nwhich my father was fond; while “Mortgages” it was not until later in\r\nlife I discovered had no connection with poems in manuscript, some in\r\ncourse of correction, others completed.\r\n\r\nNow, as the door opened, he rose and came towards us. His hair stood up\r\nfrom his head, for it was a habit of his to rumple it as he talked; and\r\nthis added to his evident efforts to compose his face into an expression\r\nof businesslike gravity, added emphasis, if such were needed, to the\r\nsuggestion of the over long schoolboy making believe.\r\n\r\n“This is the youngster,” said my father, taking me from my mother, and\r\npassing me on. “Tall for his age, isn't he?”\r\n\r\nWith a twist of his thick lips, he rolled the evil-smelling cigar he was\r\nsmoking from the left corner of his mouth to the right; and held out a\r\nfat and not too clean hand, which, as it closed round mine, brought to\r\nmy mind the picture of the walrus in my natural history book; with the\r\nother he flapped me kindly on the head.\r\n\r\n“Like 'is mother, wonderfully like 'is mother, ain't 'e?” he observed,\r\nstill holding my hand. “And that,” he added with a wink of one of his\r\nsmall eyes towards my father, “is about the 'ighest compliment I can pay\r\n'im, eh?”\r\n\r\nHis eyes were remarkably small, but marvellously bright and piercing; so\r\nmuch so that when he turned them again upon me I tried to think quickly\r\nof something nice about him, feeling sure that he could see right into\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“And where are you thinkin' of sendin' 'im?” he continued; “Eton or\r\n'Arrow?”\r\n\r\n“We haven't quite made up our minds as yet,” replied my father; “at\r\npresent we are educating him at home.”\r\n\r\n“You take my tip,” said the fat man, “and learn all you can. Look at\r\nme! If I'd 'ad the opportunity of being a schollard I wouldn't be here\r\noffering your father an extravagant price for doin' my work; I'd be able\r\nto do it myself.”\r\n\r\n“You seem to have got on very well without it,” laughed my father;\r\nand in truth his air of prosperity might have justified greater\r\nself-complacency. Rings sparkled on his blunt fingers, and upon the\r\nswelling billows of his waistcoat rose and sank a massive gold cable.\r\n\r\n“I'd 'ave done better with it,” he grunted.\r\n\r\n“But you look very clever,” I said; and though divining with a child's\r\ncuteness that it was desired I should make a favourable impression upon\r\nhim, I hoped this would please him, the words were yet spontaneous.\r\n\r\nHe laughed heartily, his whole body shaking like some huge jelly.\r\n\r\n“Well, old Noel Hasluck's not exactly a fool,” he assented, “but I'd\r\nlike myself better if I could talk about something else than business,\r\nand didn't drop my aitches. And so would my little gell.”\r\n\r\n“You have a daughter?” asked my mother, with whom a child, as a bond\r\nof sympathy with the stranger took the place assigned by most women to\r\ndisrespectful cooks and incompetent housemaids.\r\n\r\n“I won't tell you about 'er. But I'll just bring 'er to see you now and\r\nthen, ma'am, if you don't mind,” answered Mr. Hasluck. “She don't often\r\nmeet gentle-folks, an' it'll do 'er good.”\r\n\r\nMy mother glanced across at my father, but the man, intercepting her\r\nquestion, replied to it himself.\r\n\r\n“You needn't be afraid, ma'am, that she's anything like me,” he assured\r\nher quite good-temperedly; “nobody ever believes she's my daughter,\r\nexcept me and the old woman. She's a little lady, she is. Freak o'\r\nnature, I call it.”\r\n\r\n“We shall be delighted,” explained my mother.\r\n\r\n“Well, you will when you see 'er,” replied Mr. Hasluck, quite\r\ncontentedly.\r\n\r\nHe pushed half-a-crown into my hand, overriding my parents'\r\nsusceptibilities with the easy good-temper of a man accustomed to have\r\nhis way in all things.\r\n\r\n“No squanderin' it on the 'eathen,” was his parting injunction as I left\r\nthe room; “you spend that on a Christian tradesman.”\r\n\r\nIt was the first money I ever remember having to spend, that half-crown\r\nof old Hasluck's; suggestions of the delights to be derived from a new\r\npair of gloves for Sunday, from a Latin grammar, which would then be all\r\nmy own, and so on, having hitherto displaced all less exalted visions\r\nconcerning the disposal of chance coins coming into my small hands. But\r\non this occasion I was left free to decide for myself.\r\n\r\nThe anxiety it gave me! the long tossing hours in bed! the tramping of\r\nthe bewildering streets! Even advice when asked for was denied me.\r\n\r\n“You must learn to think for yourself,” said my father, who spoke\r\neloquently on the necessity of early acquiring sound judgment and what\r\nhe called “commercial aptitude.”\r\n\r\n“No, dear,” said my mother, “Mr. Hasluck wanted you to spend it as you\r\nlike. If I told you, that would be spending it as I liked. Your father\r\nand I want to see what you will do with it.”\r\n\r\nThe good little boys in the books bought presents or gave away to people\r\nin distress. For this I hated them with the malignity the lower nature\r\never feels", " acquiring sound judgment and what\r\nhe called “commercial aptitude.”\r\n\r\n“No, dear,” said my mother, “Mr. Hasluck wanted you to spend it as you\r\nlike. If I told you, that would be spending it as I liked. Your father\r\nand I want to see what you will do with it.”\r\n\r\nThe good little boys in the books bought presents or gave away to people\r\nin distress. For this I hated them with the malignity the lower nature\r\never feels towards the higher. I consulted my aunt Fan.\r\n\r\n“If somebody gave you half-a-crown,” I put it to her, “what would you\r\nbuy with it?”\r\n\r\n“Side-combs,” said my aunt; she was always losing or breaking her\r\nside-combs.\r\n\r\n“But I mean if you were me,” I explained.\r\n\r\n“Drat the child!” said my aunt; “how do I know what he wants if he don't\r\nknow himself? Idiot!”\r\n\r\nThe shop windows into which I stared, my nose glued to the pane! The\r\nthings I asked the price of! The things I made up my mind to buy and\r\nthen decided that I wouldn't buy! Even my patient mother began to show\r\nsigns of irritation. It was rapidly assuming the dimensions of a family\r\ncurse, was old Hasluck's half-crown.\r\n\r\nThen one day I made up my mind, and so ended the trouble. In the window\r\nof a small plumber's shop in a back street near, stood on view among\r\nbrass taps, rolls of lead piping and cistern requisites, various squares\r\nof coloured glass, the sort of thing chiefly used, I believe, for\r\nlavatory doors and staircase windows. Some had stars in the centre,\r\nand others, more elaborate, were enriched with designs, severe but\r\ninoffensive. I purchased a dozen of these, the plumber, an affable\r\nman who appeared glad to see me, throwing in two extra out of sheer\r\ngenerosity.\r\n\r\nWhy I bought them I did not know at the time, and I do not know now.\r\nMy mother cried when she saw them. My father could get no further than:\r\n“But what are you going to do with them?” to which I was unable to\r\nreply. My aunt, alone, attempted comfort.\r\n\r\n“If a person fancies coloured glass,” said my aunt, “then he's a fool\r\nnot to buy coloured glass when he gets the chance. We haven't all the\r\nsame tastes.”\r\n\r\nIn the end, I cut myself badly with them and consented to their being\r\nthrown into the dust-bin. But looking back, I have come to regard myself\r\nrather as the victim of Fate than of Folly. Many folks have I met since,\r\nrecipients of Hasluck's half-crowns--many a man who has slapped his\r\npocket and blessed the day he first met that “Napoleon of Finance,”\r\n as later he came to be known among his friends--but it ever ended so;\r\ncoloured glass and cut fingers. Is it fairy gold that he and his kind\r\nfling round? It would seem to be.\r\n\r\nNext time old Hasluck knocked at our front door a maid in cap and apron\r\nopened it to him, and this was but the beginning of change. New oilcloth\r\nglistened in the passage. Lace curtains, such as in that neighbourhood\r\nwere the hall-mark of the plutocrat, advertised our rising fortunes to\r\nthe street, and greatest marvel of all, at least to my awed eyes, my\r\nfather's Sunday clothes came into weekday wear, new ones taking their\r\nplace in the great wardrobe that hitherto had been the stronghold of\r\nour gentility; to which we had ever turned for comfort when rendered\r\ndespondent by contemplation of the weakness of our outer walls. “Seeing\r\nthat everything was all right” is how my mother would explain it. She\r\nwould lay the lilac silk upon the bed, fondly soothing down its rustling\r\nundulations, lingering lovingly over its deep frosted flounces of rich\r\nHoniton. Maybe she had entered the room weary looking and depressed, but\r\nsoon there would proceed from her a gentle humming as from some small\r\nwinged thing when the sun first touches it and warms it, and sometimes\r\nby the time the Indian shawl, which could go through a wedding ring, but\r\nnever would when it was wanted to, had been refolded and fastened again\r\nwith the great cameo brooch, and the poke bonnet, like some fractious\r\nchild, shaken and petted into good condition, she would be singing\r\nsoftly to herself, nodding her head to the words: which were generally\r\nto the effect that somebody was too old and somebody else too bold and\r\nanother too cold, “so he wouldn't do for me;” and stepping lightly as\r\nthough the burden of the years had fallen from her.\r\n\r\nOne evening--it was before the advent of this Hasluck--I remember\r\nclimbing out of bed, for trouble was within me. Creatures, indescribable\r\nbut heavy, had sat upon my chest, after which I had fallen downstairs,\r\nslowly and reasonably for the first few hundred flights, then with haste\r\nfor the next million miles or so, until I found myself in the street\r\nwith nothing on but my nightshirt. Personally, I was shocked, but nobody\r\nelse seemed to mind, and I hailed a two-penny 'bus and climbed in. But\r\nwhen I tried to pay I found I hadn't any pockets, so I jumped out and\r\nran away and the conductor came after me. My feet were like lead, and\r\nwith every step he gained on me, till with a scream I made one mighty\r\neffort and awoke.\r\n\r\nFeeling the need of comfort after these unpleasant but by no means\r\nunfamiliar experiences, I wrapped some clothes round me and crept\r\ndownstairs. The “office” was dark, but to my surprise a light shone from\r\nunder the drawing-room door, and I opened it.\r\n\r\nThe candles in the silver candlesticks were lighted, and in state,\r\none in each easy-chair, sat my father and mother, both in their best\r\nclothes; my father in the buckled shoes and the frilled shirt that I had\r\nnever seen him wear before, my mother with the Indian shawl about her\r\nshoulders, and upon her head the cap of ceremony that reposed three\r\nhundred and sixty days out of the year in its round wicker-work nest\r\nlined with silk. They started guiltily as I pushed open the door, but I\r\ncongratulate myself that I had sense enough--or was it instinct--to ask\r\nno questions.\r\n\r\nThe last time I had seen them, three hours ago, they had been engaged,\r\nthe lights carefully extinguished, cleaning the ground floor windows,\r\nmy father the outside, my mother within, and it astonished me the change\r\nnot only in their appearance, but in their manner and bearing, and even\r\nin their very voices. My father brought over from the sideboard the\r\nsherry and sweet biscuits and poured out and handed a glass to my\r\nmother, and he and my mother drank to each other, while I between them\r\nate the biscuits, and the conversation was of Byron's poems and the\r\ngreat glass palace in Hyde Park.\r\n\r\nI wonder am I disloyal setting this down? Maybe to others it shows but\r\na foolish man and woman, and that is far from my intention. I dwell\r\nupon such trifles because to me the memory of them is very tender. The\r\nvirtues of our loved ones we admire, yet after all 'tis but what we\r\nexpected of them: how could they do otherwise? Their failings we would\r\nforget; no one of us is perfect. But over their follies we love to\r\nlinger, smiling.\r\n\r\nTo me personally, old Hasluck's coming and all that followed thereupon\r\nmade perhaps more difference than to any one else. My father now was\r\nbusy all the day; if not in his office, then away in the grim city of\r\nthe giants, as I still thought of it; while to my mother came every day\r\nmore social and domestic duties; so that for a time I was left much to\r\nmy own resources.\r\n\r\nRambling--“bummelling,” as the Germans term it--was my bent. This my\r\nmother would have checked, but my father said:\r\n\r\n“Don't molly-coddle him. Let him learn to be smart.”\r\n\r\n“I don't think the smart people are always the nicest,” demurred my\r\nmother. “I don't call", " my mother came every day\r\nmore social and domestic duties; so that for a time I was left much to\r\nmy own resources.\r\n\r\nRambling--“bummelling,” as the Germans term it--was my bent. This my\r\nmother would have checked, but my father said:\r\n\r\n“Don't molly-coddle him. Let him learn to be smart.”\r\n\r\n“I don't think the smart people are always the nicest,” demurred my\r\nmother. “I don't call you at all 'smart,' Luke.”\r\n\r\nMy father appeared surprised, but reflected.\r\n\r\n“I should call myself smart--in a sense,” he explained, after\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you are right, dear,” replied my mother; “and of course boys\r\nare different from girls.”\r\n\r\nSometimes I would wander Victoria Park way, which was then surrounded by\r\nmany small cottages in leafy gardens; or even reach as far as Clapton,\r\nwhere old red brick Georgian houses still stood behind high palings, and\r\ntall elms gave to the wide road on sunny afternoons an old-world air of\r\npeace. But such excursions were the exception, for strange though it may\r\nread, the narrow, squalid streets had greater hold on me. Not the few\r\nmain thoroughfares, filled ever with a dull, deep throbbing as of some\r\ntireless iron machine; where the endless human files, streaming ever up\r\nand down, crossing and recrossing, seemed mere rushing chains of flesh\r\nand blood, working upon unseen wheels; but the dim, weary, lifeless\r\nstreets--the dark, tortuous roots, as I fancied them, of that grim\r\nforest of entangled brick. Mystery lurked in their gloom. Fear whispered\r\nfrom behind their silence. Dumb figures flitted swiftly to and fro,\r\nnever pausing, never glancing right nor left. Far-off footsteps, rising\r\nswiftly into sound, as swiftly fading, echoed round their lonely comers.\r\nDreading, yet drawn on, I would creep along their pavements as through\r\nsome city of the dead, thinking of the eyes I saw not watching from the\r\nthousand windows; starting at each muffled sound penetrating the long,\r\ndreary walls, behind which that close-packed, writhing life lay hid.\r\n\r\nOne day there came a cry from behind a curtained window. I stood still\r\nfor a moment and then ran; but before I could get far enough away I\r\nheard it again, a long, piercing cry, growing fiercer before it ceased;\r\nso that I ran faster still, not heeding where I went, till I found\r\nmyself in a raw, unfinished street, ending in black waste land,\r\nbordering the river. I stopped, panting, wondering how I should find\r\nmy way again. To recover myself and think I sat upon the doorstep of\r\nan empty house, and there came dancing down the road with a curious,\r\nhalf-running, half-hopping step--something like a water wagtail's--a\r\nchild, a boy about my own age, who, after eyeing me strangely sat down\r\nbeside me.\r\n\r\nWe watched each other for a few minutes; and I noticed that his mouth\r\nkept opening and shutting, though he said nothing. Suddenly, edging\r\ncloser to me, he spoke in a thick whisper. It sounded as though his\r\nmouth were full of wool.\r\n\r\n“Wot 'appens to yer when yer dead?”\r\n\r\n“If you're good you go to Heaven. If you're bad you go to Hell.”\r\n\r\n“Long way off, both of 'em, ain't they?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Millions of miles.”\r\n\r\n“They can't come after yer? Can't fetch yer back again?”\r\n\r\n“No, never.”\r\n\r\nThe doorstep that we occupied was the last. A yard beyond began the\r\nblack waste of mud. From the other end of the street, now growing dark,\r\nhe never took his staring eyes for an instant.\r\n\r\n“Ever seen a stiff 'un--a dead 'un?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“I 'ave--stuck a pin into 'im. 'E never felt it. Don't feel anything\r\nwhen yer dead, do yer?”\r\n\r\nAll the while he kept swaying his body to and fro, twisting his arms\r\nand legs, and making faces. Comical figures made of ginger-bread, with\r\nquaintly curved limbs and grinning features, were to be bought then in\r\nbakers' shops: he made me hungry, reminding me of such.\r\n\r\n“Of course not. When you are dead you're not there, you know. Our bodies\r\nare but senseless clay.” I was glad I remembered that line. I tried to\r\nthink of the next one, which was about food for worms; but it evaded me.\r\n\r\n“I like you,” he said; and making a fist, he gave me a punch in\r\nthe chest. It was the token of palship among the youth of that\r\nneighbourhood, and gravely I returned it, meaning it, for friendship\r\nwith children is an affair of the instant, or not at all, and I knew him\r\nfor my first chum.\r\n\r\nHe wormed himself up.\r\n\r\n“Yer won't tell?” he said.\r\n\r\nI had no notion what I was not to tell, but our compact demanded that I\r\nshould agree.\r\n\r\n“Say 'I swear.'”\r\n\r\n“I swear.”\r\n\r\nThe heroes of my favourite fiction bound themselves by such like secret\r\noaths. Here evidently was a comrade after my own heart.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, cockey.”\r\n\r\nBut he turned again, and taking from his pocket an old knife, thrust it\r\ninto my hand. Then with that extraordinary hopping movement of his ran\r\noff across the mud.\r\n\r\nI stood watching him, wondering where he could be going. He stumbled\r\na little further, where the mud began to get softer and deeper, but\r\nstruggling up again, went hopping on towards the river.\r\n\r\nI shouted to him, but he never looked back. At every few yards he would\r\nsink down almost to his knees in the black mud, but wrenching himself\r\nfree would flounder forward. Then, still some distance from the river,\r\nhe fell upon his face, and did not rise again. I saw his arms beating\r\nfeebler and feebler as he sank till at last the oily slime closed over\r\nhim, and I could detect nothing but a faint heaving underneath the mud.\r\nAnd after a time even that ceased.\r\n\r\nIt was late before I reached home, and fortunately my father and mother\r\nwere still out. I did not tell any one what I had seen, having sworn not\r\nto; and as time went on the incident haunted me less and less until\r\nit became subservient to my will. But of my fancy for those silent,\r\nlifeless streets it cured me for the time. From behind their still walls\r\nI would hear that long cry; down their narrow vistas see that writhing\r\nfigure, like some animated ginger-bread, hopping, springing, falling.\r\n\r\nYet in the more crowded streets another trouble awaited me, one more\r\ntangible.\r\n\r\nHave you ever noticed a pack of sparrows round some crumbs perchance\r\nthat you have thrown out from your window? Suddenly the rest of the\r\nflock will set upon one. There is a tremendous Lilliputian hubbub,\r\na tossing of tiny wings and heads, a babel of shrill chirps. It is\r\ncomical.\r\n\r\n“Spiteful little imps they are,” you say to yourself, much amused.\r\n\r\nSo I have heard good-tempered men and women calling out to one another\r\nwith a laugh.\r\n\r\n“There go those young devils chivvying that poor little beggar again;\r\nought to be ashamed of theirselves.”\r\n\r\nBut, oh! the anguish of the poor little beggar! Can any one who has not\r\nbeen through it imagine it! Reduced to its actualities, what was it?\r\nGibes and jeers that, after all, break no bones. A few pinches,\r\nkicks and slaps; at worst a few hard knocks. But the dreading of it\r\nbeforehand! Terror lived in every street, hid, waiting for me, round\r\neach corner. The half-dozen wrangling over their marbles--had they seen\r\nme? The boy whistling as he stood staring into the print shop, would I\r\nget past him without his noticing me; or would he, swinging round upon\r\nhis heel, raise the shrill whoop that brought them from every doorway to\r\nhunt me?\r\n\r\nThe shame, when caught at last and cornered: the grinning face that\r\n", ", hid, waiting for me, round\r\neach corner.

The after humiliation when, finally released, I would dart away,\r\nfollowed by shouted taunts and laughter; every eye turned to watch me,\r\nshrinking by; my whole small carcass shaking with dry sobs of bitterness\r\nand rage!\r\n\r\nIf only I could have turned and faced them! So far as the mere bearing\r\nof pain was concerned, I knew myself brave. The physical suffering\r\nresulting from any number of stand-up fights would have been trivial\r\ncompared with the mental agony I endured. That I, the comrade of a\r\nhundred heroes--I, who nightly rode with Richard Coeur de Lion,\r\nwho against Sir Lancelot himself had couched a lance, and that not\r\naltogether unsuccessful, I to whom all damsels in distress were wont to\r\nlook for succour--that I should run from varlets such as these!\r\n\r\nMy friend, my bosom friend, good Robin Hood! how would he have behaved\r\nunder similar circumstances? how Ivanhoe, my chosen companion in all\r\nquests of knightly enterprise? how--to come to modern times--Jack\r\nHarkaway, mere schoolboy though he might be? Would not one and all\r\nhave welcomed such incident with a joyous shout, and in a trice have\r\nscattered to the winds the worthless herd?\r\n\r\nBut, alas! upon my pale lips the joyous shout sank into an unheard\r\nwhisper, and the thing that became scattered to the wind was myself, the\r\nfirst opening that occurred.\r\n\r\nSometimes, the blood boiling in my veins, I would turn, thinking to go\r\nback and at all risk defying my tormentors, prove to myself I was no\r\ncoward. But before I had retraced my steps a dozen paces, I would see\r\nin imagination the whole scene again before me: the laughing crowd,\r\nthe halting passers-by, the spiteful, mocking little faces every way I\r\nturned; and so instead would creep on home, and climbing stealthily up\r\ninto my own room, cry my heart out in the dark upon my bed.\r\n\r\nUntil one blessed day, when a blessed Fairy, in the form of a small\r\nkitten, lifted the spell that bound me, and set free my limbs.\r\n\r\nI have always had a passionate affection for the dumb world, if it be\r\ndumb. My first playmate, I remember, was a water rat. A stream ran at\r\nthe bottom of our garden; and sometimes, escaping the vigilant eye of\r\nMrs. Fursey, I would steal out with my supper and join him on the banks.\r\nThere, hidden behind the osiers, we would play at banquets, he, it is\r\ntrue, doing most of the banqueting, and I the make-believe. But it was\r\na good game; added to which it was the only game I could ever get him to\r\nplay, though I tried. He was a one-ideaed rat.\r\n\r\nLater I came into the possession of a white specimen all my own. He\r\nlived chiefly in the outside breast pocket of my jacket, in company with\r\nmy handkerchief, so that glancing down I could generally see his little\r\npink eyes gleaming up at me, except on very cold days, when it would be\r\nonly his tail that I could see; and when I felt miserable, somehow he\r\nwould know it, and, swarming up, push his little cold snout against\r\nmy ear. He died just so, clinging round my neck; and from many of my\r\nfellow-men and women have I parted with less pain. It sounds callous to\r\nsay so; but, after all, our feelings are not under our own control; and\r\nI have never been able to understand the use of pretending to emotions\r\none has not. All this, however, comes later. Let me return now to my\r\nfairy kitten.\r\n\r\nI heard its cry of pain from afar, and instinctively hastened my steps.\r\nThree or four times I heard it again, and at each call I ran faster,\r\ntill, breathless, I arrived upon the scene, the opening of a narrow\r\ncourt, leading out of a by-street. At first I saw nothing but the backs\r\nof a small mob of urchins. Then from the centre of them came another\r\nwailing appeal for help, and without waiting for any invitation, I\r\npushed my way into the group.\r\n\r\nWhat I saw was Hecuba to me--gave me the motive and the cue for passion,\r\ntransformed me from the dull and muddy-mettled little John-a-dreams I\r\nhad been into a small, blind Fury. Pale Thought, that mental emetic,\r\nbanished from my system, I became the healthy, unreasoning animal, and\r\nacted as such.\r\n\r\nFrom my methods, I frankly admit, science was absent. In simple,\r\nprimitive fashion that would have charmed a Darwinian disciple to\r\nobserve, I “went for” the whole crowd. To employ the expressive idiom of\r\nthe neighbourhood, I was “all over it and inside.” Something clung about\r\nmy feet. By kicking myself free and then standing on it I gained the\r\nadvantage of quite an extra foot in height; I don't know what it was and\r\ndidn't care. I fought with my arms and I fought with my legs; where I\r\ncould get in with my head I did. I fought whatever came to hand in\r\na spirit of simple thankfulness, grateful for what I could reach and\r\nindifferent to what was beyond me.\r\n\r\nThat the “show”--if again I may be permitted the local idiom--was not\r\nentirely mine I was well aware. That not alone my person but my property\r\nalso was being damaged in the rear became dimly conveyed to me through\r\nthe sensation of draught. Already the world to the left of me was mere\r\npicturesque perspective, while the growing importance of my nose was\r\nthreatening the absorption of all my other features. These things did\r\nnot trouble me. I merely noted them as phenomena and continued to punch\r\nsteadily.\r\n\r\nUntil I found that I was punching something soft and yet unyielding.\r\nI looked up to see what this foreign matter that thus mysteriously had\r\nentered into the mixture might be, and discovered it to be a policeman.\r\nStill I did not care. The felon's dock! the prison cell! a fig for such\r\nmere bogies. An impudent word, an insulting look, and I would have gone\r\nfor the Law itself. Pale Thought--it must have been a livid green by\r\nthis time--still trembled at respectful distance from me.\r\n\r\nFortunately for all of us, he was not impertinent, and though he spoke\r\nthe language of his order, his tone disarmed offence.\r\n\r\n“Now, then. Now, then. What is all this about?”\r\n\r\nThere was no need for me to answer. A dozen voluble tongues were ready\r\nto explain to him; and to explain wholly in my favour. This time the\r\ncrowd was with me. Let a man school himself to bear dispraise, for\r\nthereby alone shall he call his soul his own. But let no man lie, saying\r\nhe is indifferent to popular opinion. That was my first taste of public\r\napplause. The public was not select, and the applause might, by the\r\nsticklers for English pure and undefiled, have been deemed ill-worded,\r\nbut to me it was the sweetest music I had ever heard, or have heard\r\nsince. I was called a “plucky little devil,” a “fair 'ot 'un,” not only\r\na “good 'un,” but a “good 'un” preceded by the adjective that in\r\nthe East bestows upon its principal every admirable quality that can\r\npossibly apply. Under the circumstances it likewise fitted me literally;\r\nbut I knew it was intended rather in its complimentary sense.\r\n\r\nKind, if dirty, hands wiped my face. A neighbouring butcher presented me", ", or have heard\r\nsince. I was called a “plucky little devil,” a “fair 'ot 'un,” not only\r\na “good 'un,” but a “good 'un” preceded by the adjective that in\r\nthe East bestows upon its principal every admirable quality that can\r\npossibly apply. Under the circumstances it likewise fitted me literally;\r\nbut I knew it was intended rather in its complimentary sense.\r\n\r\nKind, if dirty, hands wiped my face. A neighbouring butcher presented me\r\nwith a choice morsel of steak, not to eat but to wear; and I found it,\r\nif I may so express myself without infringing copyright, “grateful and\r\ncomforting.” My enemies had long since scooted, some of them, I had\r\nrejoiced to notice, with lame and halting steps. The mutilated kitten\r\nhad been restored to its owner, a lady of ample bosom, who, carried\r\nbeyond judgment by emotion, publicly offered to adopt me on the spot.\r\nThe Law suggested, not for the first time, that everybody should now\r\nmove on; and slowly, followed by feminine commendation mingled with\r\nmasculine advice as to improved methods for the future, I was allowed to\r\ndrift away.\r\n\r\nMy bones ached, my flesh stung me, yet I walked as upon air. Gradually\r\nI became conscious that I was not alone. A light, pattering step was\r\ntrying to keep pace with me. Graciously I slacked my speed, and the\r\npattering step settled down beside me. Every now and again she would run\r\nahead and then turn round to look up into my face, much as your small\r\ndog does when he happens not to be misbehaving himself and desires you\r\nto note the fact. Evidently she approved of me. I was not at my best,\r\nas far as appearance was concerned, but women are kittle cattle, and\r\nI think she preferred me so. Thus we walked for quite a long distance\r\nwithout speaking, I drinking in the tribute of her worship and enjoying\r\nit. Then gaining confidence, she shyly put her hand into mine, and\r\nfinding I did not repel her, promptly assumed possession of me,\r\naccording to woman's way.\r\n\r\nFor her age and station she must have been a person of means, for having\r\ntried in vain various methods to make me more acceptable to followers\r\nand such as having passed would turn their heads, she said:\r\n\r\n“I know, gelatines;” and disappearing into a sweetstuff shop, returned\r\nwith quite a quantity. With these, first sucked till glutinous, we\r\njoined my many tatters. I still attracted attention, but felt warmer.\r\n\r\nShe informed me that her name was Cissy, and that her father's shop was\r\nin Three Colt Street. I informed her that my name was Paul, and that\r\nmy father was a lawyer. I also pointed out to her that a lawyer is much\r\nsuperior in social position to a shopkeeper, which she acknowledged\r\ncheerfully. We parted at the corner of the Stainsby Road, and I let her\r\nkiss me once. It was understood that in the Stainsby Road we might meet\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nI left Eliza gaping after me, the front door in her hand, and ran\r\nstraight up into my own room. Robinson Crusoe, King Arthur, The Last of\r\nthe Barons, Rob Roy! I looked them all in the face and was not ashamed.\r\nI also was a gentleman.\r\n\r\nMy mother was much troubled when she saw me, but my father, hearing the\r\nstory, approved.\r\n\r\n“But he looks so awful,” said my mother. “In this world,” said my\r\nfather, “one must occasionally be aggressive--if necessary, brutal.”\r\n\r\nMy father would at times be quite savage in his sentiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPAUL, FALLING IN WITH A GOODLY COMPANY OF PILGRIMS, LEARNS OF THEM THE\r\nROAD THAT HE MUST TRAVEL. AND MEETS THE PRINCESS OF THE GOLDEN LOCKS.\r\n\r\nThe East India Dock Road is nowadays a busy, crowded thoroughfare. The\r\njingle of the tram-bell and the rattle of the omnibus and cart mingle\r\ncontinuously with the rain of many feet, beating ceaselessly upon its\r\npavements. But at the time of which I write it was an empty, voiceless\r\nway, bounded on the one side by the long, echoing wall of the docks and\r\non the other by occasional small houses isolated amid market gardens,\r\ndrying grounds and rubbish heaps. Only one thing remains--or did remain\r\nlast time I passed along it, connecting it with its former self--and\r\nthat is the one-storeyed brick cottage at the commencement of the\r\nbridge, and which was formerly the toll-house. I remember this\r\ntoll-house so well because it was there that my childhood fell from me,\r\nand sad and frightened I saw the world beyond.\r\n\r\nI cannot explain it better. I had been that afternoon to Plaistow on a\r\nvisit to the family dentist. It was an out-of-the-way place in which to\r\nkeep him, but there existed advantages of a counterbalancing nature.\r\n\r\n“Have the half-crown in your hand,” my mother would direct me, while\r\nmaking herself sure that the purse containing it was safe at the bottom\r\nof my knickerbocker pocket; “but of course if he won't take it, why, you\r\nmust bring it home again.”\r\n\r\nI am not sure, but I think he was some distant connection of ours; at\r\nall events, I know he was a kind friend. I, seated in the velvet chair\r\nof state, he would unroll his case of instruments before me, and ask me\r\nto choose, recommending with affectionate eulogisms the most murderous\r\nlooking.\r\n\r\nBut on my opening my mouth to discuss the fearful topic, lo! a pair\r\nwould shoot from under his coat-sleeve, and almost before I knew what\r\nhad happened, the trouble would be over. After that we would have\r\ntea together. He was an old bachelor, and his house stood in a great\r\ngarden--for Plaistow in those days was a picturesque village--and out of\r\nthe plentiful fruit thereof his housekeeper made the most wonderful\r\nof jams and jellies. Oh, they were good, those teas! Generally our\r\nconversation was of my mother who, it appeared, was once a little girl:\r\nnot at all the sort of little girl I should have imagined her; on the\r\ncontrary, a prankish, wilful little girl, though good company, I should\r\nsay, if all the tales he told of her were true. And I am inclined to\r\nthink they were, in spite of the fact that my mother, when I repeated\r\nthem to her, would laugh, saying she was sure she had no recollection of\r\nanything of the kind, adding severely that it was a pity he and I could\r\nnot find something better to gossip about. Yet her next question would\r\nbe:\r\n\r\n“And what else did he say, if you please?” explaining impatiently when\r\nmy answer was not of the kind expected: “No, no, I mean about me.”\r\n\r\nThe tea things cleared away, he would bring out his great microscope.\r\nTo me it was a peep-hole into a fairy world where dwelt strange dragons,\r\nmighty monsters, so that I came to regard him as a sort of harmless\r\nmagician. It was his pet study, and looking back, I cannot help\r\nassociating his enthusiasm for all things microscopical with the fact\r\nthat he was an exceptionally little man himself, but one of the biggest\r\nhearted that ever breathed.\r\n\r\nOn leaving I would formally hand him my half-crown, “with mamma's\r\ncompliments,” and he would formally accept it. But on putting my hand\r\ninto my jacket pocket when outside the gate I would invariably find\r\nit there. The first time I took it back to him, but unblushingly he\r\nrepudiated all knowledge.\r\n\r\n“Must be another half-crown,” he suggested; “such things do happen.\r\nOne puts change into a pocket and overlooks it. Slippery things,\r\nhalf-crowns.”\r\n\r\nReturning home on this particular day of days, I paused upon the bridge,\r\nand watched for awhile the lazy barges manoeuvring their way between the\r\npiers. It was one of those hushed summer evenings when the air even of\r\ngrim cities is full of whispering voices; and as, turning away from the\r\nriver, I passed through the white toll-gate, I had", "One puts change into a pocket and overlooks it. Slippery things,\r\nhalf-crowns.”\r\n\r\nReturning home on this particular day of days, I paused upon the bridge,\r\nand watched for awhile the lazy barges manoeuvring their way between the\r\npiers. It was one of those hushed summer evenings when the air even of\r\ngrim cities is full of whispering voices; and as, turning away from the\r\nriver, I passed through the white toll-gate, I had a sense of leaving\r\nmyself behind me on the bridge. So vivid was the impression, that I\r\nlooked back, half expecting to see myself still leaning over the iron\r\nparapet, looking down into the sunlit water.\r\n\r\nIt sounds foolish, but I leave it standing, wondering if to others a\r\nlike experience has ever come. The little chap never came back to me.\r\nHe passed away from me as a man's body may possibly pass away from him,\r\nleaving him only remembrance and regret. For a time I tried to play his\r\ngames, to dream his dreams, but the substance was wanting. I was only a\r\nthin ghost, making believe.\r\n\r\nIt troubled me for quite a spell of time, even to the point of tears,\r\nthis feeling that my childhood lay behind me, this sudden realisation\r\nthat I was travelling swiftly the strange road called growing up. I did\r\nnot want to grow up; could nothing be done to stop it? Rather would I\r\nbe always as I had been, playing, dreaming. The dark way frightened me.\r\nMust I go forward?\r\n\r\nThen gradually, but very slowly, with the long months and years, came\r\nto me the consciousness of a new being, new pulsations, sensories,\r\nthrobbings, rooted in but differing widely from the old; and little\r\nPaul, the Paul of whom I have hitherto spoken, faded from my life.\r\n\r\nSo likewise must I let him fade with sorrow from this book. But before\r\nI part with him entirely, let me recall what else I can remember of him.\r\nThus we shall be quit of him, and he will interfere with us no more.\r\n\r\nChief among the pictures that I see is that of my aunt Fan, crouching\r\nover the kitchen fire; her skirt and crinoline rolled up round her\r\nwaist, leaving as sacrifice to custom only her petticoat. Up and down\r\nher body sways in rhythmic motion, her hands stroking affectionately\r\nher own knees; the while I, with paper knife for sword, or horse of\r\nbroomstick, stand opposite her, flourishing and declaiming. Sometimes I\r\nam a knight and she a wicked ogre. She is slain, growling and swearing,\r\nand at once becomes the beautiful princess that I secure and bear away\r\nwith me upon the prancing broomstick. So long as the princess is merely\r\nholding sweet converse with me from her high-barred window, the scene\r\nis realistic, at least, to sufficiency; but the bearing away has to be\r\nmake-believe; for my aunt cannot be persuaded to leave her chair before\r\nthe fire, and the everlasting rubbing of her knees.\r\n\r\nAt other times, with the assistance of the meat chopper, I am an Indian\r\nbrave, and then she is Laughing Water or Singing Sunshine, and we go out\r\nscalping together; or in less bloodthirsty moods I am the Fairy Prince\r\nand she the Sleeping Beauty. But in such parts she is not at her best.\r\nBetter, when seated in the centre of the up-turned table, I am Captain\r\nCook, and she the Cannibal Chief.\r\n\r\n“I shall skin him and hang him in the larder till Sunday week,” says my\r\naunt, smacking her lips, “then he'll be just in right condition; not too\r\ntough and not too high.” She was always strong in detail, was my aunt\r\nFan.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to deprive my aunt of any credit due to her, but the more\r\nI exercise my memory for evidence, the more I am convinced that her\r\ncompliance on these occasions was not conceived entirely in the spirit\r\nof self-sacrifice. Often would she suggest the game and even the theme;\r\nin such case, casting herself invariably for what, in old theatrical\r\nparlance, would have been termed the heavy lead, the dragons and the\r\nwicked uncles, the fussy necromancers and the uninvited fairies. As\r\nauthoress of a new cookery book for use in giant-land, my aunt, I am\r\nsure, would have been successful. Most recipes that one reads are so\r\nmonotonously meagre: “Boil him,” “Put her on the spit and roast her for\r\nsupper,” “Cook 'em in a pie--with plenty of gravy;” but my aunt into the\r\ndomestic economy of Ogredom introduced variety and daintiness.\r\n\r\n“I think, my dear,” my aunt would direct, “we'll have him stuffed with\r\nchestnuts and served on toast. And don't forget the giblets. They make\r\nsuch excellent sauce.”\r\n\r\nWith regard to the diet of imprisoned maidens she would advise:\r\n\r\n“Not too much fish--it spoils the flesh for roasting.”\r\n\r\nThe things that she would turn people into--king's sons, rightful\r\nprincesses, such sort of people--people who after a time, one would\r\nthink, must have quite forgotten what they started as. To let her\r\nhave her way was a lesson to me in natural history both present and\r\npre-historic. The most beautiful damsel that ever lived she would\r\nwithout a moment's hesitation turn into a Glyptodon or a Hippocrepian.\r\nAfterwards, when I could guess at the spelling, I would look these\r\ncreatures up in the illustrated dictionary, and feel that under no\r\ncircumstances could I have loved the lady ever again. Warriors and kings\r\nshe would delight in transforming into plaice or prawns, and haughty\r\nqueens into Brussels sprouts.\r\n\r\nWith gusto would she plan a complicated slaughter, paying heed to every\r\ndetail: the sharpening of the knives, the having ready of mops and pails\r\nof water for purposes of after cleaning up. As a writer she would have\r\nfollowed the realistic school.\r\n\r\nHer death, with which we invariably wound up the afternoon, was another\r\nconscientious effort. Indeed, her groans and writhings would sometimes\r\nfrighten me. I always welcomed the last gurgle. That finished, but not a\r\nmoment before, my aunt would let down her skirt--in this way suggesting\r\nthe fall of the curtain upon our play--and set to work to get the tea.\r\n\r\nAnother frequently recurring picture that I see is of myself in\r\nglazed-peaked cap explaining many things the while we walk through dingy\r\nstreets to yet a smaller figure curly haired and open eyed. Still every\r\nnow and then she runs ahead to turn and look admiringly into my face as\r\non the day she first became captive to the praise and fame of me.\r\n\r\nI was glad of her company for more reasons than she knew of. For one,\r\nshe protected me against my baser self. With her beside me I should\r\nnot have dared to flee from sudden foes. Indeed, together we courted\r\nadventure; for once you get used to it this standing hazard of attack\r\nadds a charm to outdoor exercise that older folk in districts better\r\npoliced enjoy not. So possibly my dog feels when together we take the\r\nair. To me it is a simple walk, maybe a little tiresome, suggested\r\nrather by contemplation of my waistband than by desire for walking for\r\nmere walking's sake; to him an expedition full of danger and surprises:\r\n“The gentleman asleep with one eye open on The Chequer's doorstep!\r\nwill he greet me with a friendly sniff or try to bite my head off? This\r\ncross-eyed, lop-eared loafer, lurching against the lamp-post! shall we\r\npass with a careless wag and a 'how-do,' or become locked in a life and\r\ndeath struggle? Impossible to say. This coming corner, now, 'Ware! Is\r\nanybody waiting round there to kill me, or not?”\r\n\r\nBut the trusting face beside me nerved me. As reward in lonely places I\r\nwould let her hold my hand.\r\n\r\nA second advantage I derived from her company was that of being less\r\ntrampled on, less walked over, less swept aside into doorway or gutter\r\nthan when alone. A pretty, winsome face had this little", " and\r\ndeath struggle? Impossible to say. This coming corner, now, 'Ware! Is\r\nanybody waiting round there to kill me, or not?”\r\n\r\nBut the trusting face beside me nerved me. As reward in lonely places I\r\nwould let her hold my hand.\r\n\r\nA second advantage I derived from her company was that of being less\r\ntrampled on, less walked over, less swept aside into doorway or gutter\r\nthan when alone. A pretty, winsome face had this little maid, if Memory\r\nplays me not kindly false; but also she had a vocabulary; and when the\r\nblind idiot, male or female, instead of passing us by walking round us,\r\nwould, after the custom of the blind idiot, seek to gain the other side\r\nof us by walking through us, she would use it.\r\n\r\n“Now, then, where yer coming to, old glass-eye? We ain't sperrits. Can't\r\nyer see us?”\r\n\r\nAnd if they attempted reply, her child's treble, so strangely at\r\nvariance with her dainty appearance, would only rise more shrill.\r\n\r\n“Garn! They'd run out of 'eads when they was making you. That's only a\r\nturnip wot you've got stuck on top of yer!” I offer but specimens.\r\n\r\nNor was it of the slightest use attempting personal chastisement, as\r\nsometimes an irate lady or gentleman would be foolish enough to do. As\r\nwell might an hippopotamus attempt to reprove a terrier. The only result\r\nwas to provide comedy for the entire street.\r\n\r\nOn these occasions our positions were reversed, I being the admiring\r\nspectator of her prowess. Yet to me she was ever meek, almost\r\nirritatingly submissive. She found out where I lived and would often\r\ncome and wait for me for hours, her little face pressed tight against\r\nthe iron railings, until either I came out or shook my head at her from\r\nmy bedroom window, when she would run off, the dying away into silence\r\nof her pattering feet leaving me a little sad.\r\n\r\nI think I cared for her in a way, yet she never entered into my\r\nday-dreams, which means that she existed for me only in the outer world\r\nof shadows that lay round about me and was not of my real life.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think she was unwise, introducing me to the shop, for children\r\nand dogs--one seems unconsciously to bracket them in one's thoughts--are\r\nsnobbish little wretches. If only her father had been a dealer in\r\nfirewood I could have soothed myself by imagining mistakes. It was\r\na common occurrence, as I well knew, for children of quite the\r\nbest families to be brought up by wood choppers. Fairies, the best\r\nintentioned in the world, but born muddlers, were generally responsible\r\nfor these mishaps, which, however, always became righted in time for the\r\nwedding. Or even had he been a pork butcher, and there were many in the\r\nneighbourhood, I could have thought of him as a swineherd, and so found\r\nprecedent for hope.\r\n\r\nBut a fishmonger--from six in the evening a fried fishmonger! I searched\r\nhistory in vain. Fried fishmongers were without the pale.\r\n\r\nSo gradually our meetings became less frequent, though I knew that\r\nevery afternoon she waited in the quiet Stainsby Road, where dwelt in\r\nsemi-detached, six-roomed villas the aristocracy of Poplar, and that\r\nafter awhile, for arriving late at times I have been witness to the\r\nsad fact, tears would trace pathetic patterns upon her dust-besprinkled\r\ncheeks; and with the advent of the world-illuminating Barbara, to which\r\nevent I am drawing near, they ceased altogether.\r\n\r\nSo began and ended my first romance. One of these days--some quiet\r\nsummer's afternoon, when even the air of Pigott Street vibrates with\r\ntenderness beneath the whispered sighs of Memory, I shall walk into the\r\nlittle grocer's shop and boldly ask to see her. So far have I already\r\ngone as to trace her, and often have I tried to catch sight of her\r\nthrough the glass door, but hitherto in vain. I know she is the more\r\nor less troubled mother of a numerous progeny. I am told she has grown\r\nstout, and probable enough it is that her tongue has gained rather than\r\nlost in sharpness. Yet under all the unrealities the clumsy-handed world\r\nhas built about her, I shall see, I know, the lithesome little maid with\r\nfond, admiring eyes. What help they were to me I never knew till I had\r\nlost them. How hard to gain such eyes I have learned since. Were we to\r\nwrite the truth in our confession books, should we not admit the quality\r\nwe most admire in others is admiration of ourselves? And is it not a\r\nwise selection? If you would have me admirable, my friend, admire me,\r\nand speak your commendation without stint that in the sunshine of your\r\npraises I may wax. For indifference maketh an indifferent man, and\r\ncontempt a contemptible man. Come, is it not true? Does not all that is\r\nworthy in us grow best by honour?\r\n\r\nChief among the remaining figures on my childhood's stage were the many\r\nservants of our house, the “generals,” as they were termed. So rapid,\r\nas a rule, was their transit through our kitchen that only one or two,\r\nconspicuous by reason of their lingering, remain upon my view. It was a\r\nneighbourhood in which domestic servants were not much required. Those\r\nintending to take up the calling seriously went westward. The local\r\nranks were recruited mainly from the discontented or the disappointed,\r\nfrom those who, unappreciated at home, hoped from the stranger more\r\ndiscernment; or from the love-lorn, the jilted and the jealous, who took\r\nthe cap and apron as in an earlier age their like would have taken the\r\nveil. Maybe, to the comparative seclusion of our basement, as contrasted\r\nwith the alternative frivolity of shop or factory, they felt in such\r\nmood more attuned. With the advent of the new or the recovery of the old\r\nyoung man they would plunge again into the vain world, leaving my poor\r\nmother to search afresh amid the legions of the cursed.\r\n\r\nWith these I made such comradeship as I could, for I had no child\r\nfriends. Kind creatures were most of them, at least so I found them.\r\nThey were poor at “making believe,” but would always squeeze ten minutes\r\nfrom their work to romp with me, and that, perhaps, was healthier for\r\nme. What, perhaps, was not so good for me was that, staggered at\r\nthe amount of “book-learning” implied by my conversation (for the\r\njournalistic instinct, I am inclined to think, was early displayed in\r\nme), they would listen open-mouthed to all my information, regarding me\r\nas a precocious oracle. Sometimes they would obtain permission to take\r\nme home with them to tea, generously eager that their friends should\r\nalso profit by me. Then, encouraged by admiring, grinning faces, I would\r\n“hold forth,” keenly enjoying the sound of my own proud piping.\r\n\r\n“As good as a book, ain't he?” was the tribute most often paid to me.\r\n\r\n“As good as a play,” one enthusiastic listener, an old greengrocer, went\r\nso far as to say.\r\n\r\nAlready I regarded myself as among the Immortals.\r\n\r\nOne girl, a dear, wholesome creature named Janet, stayed with us for\r\nmonths and might have stayed years, but for her addiction to strong\r\nlanguage. The only and well-beloved child of the captain of the\r\nbarge “Nancy Jane,” trading between Purfleet and Ponder's End, her\r\nconversation was at once my terror and delight.\r\n\r\n“Janet,” my mother would exclaim in agony, her hands going up\r\ninstinctively to guard her ears, “how can you use such words?”\r\n\r\n“What words, mum?”\r\n\r\n“The things you have just called the gas man.”\r\n\r\n“Him! Well, did you see what he did, mum? Walked straight into my clean\r\nkitchen, without even wiping his boots, the--” And before my mother\r\ncould stop her, Janet had relieved her feelings by calling him it--or\r\nrather them--again,", ", her hands going up\r\ninstinctively to guard her ears, “how can you use such words?”\r\n\r\n“What words, mum?”\r\n\r\n“The things you have just called the gas man.”\r\n\r\n“Him! Well, did you see what he did, mum? Walked straight into my clean\r\nkitchen, without even wiping his boots, the--” And before my mother\r\ncould stop her, Janet had relieved her feelings by calling him it--or\r\nrather them--again, without any idea that she had done aught else than\r\nexpress in fitting phraseology a natural human emotion.\r\n\r\nWe were good friends, Janet and I, and therefore it was that I\r\npersonally undertook her reformation. It was not an occasion for mincing\r\none's words. The stake at issue was, I felt, too important. I told\r\nher bluntly that if she persisted in using such language she would\r\ninevitably go to hell.\r\n\r\n“Then where's my father going?” demanded Janet.\r\n\r\n“Does he use language?”\r\n\r\nI gathered from Janet that no one who had enjoyed the privilege of\r\nhearing her father could ever again take interest in the feeble efforts\r\nof herself.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid, Janet,” I explained, “that if he doesn't give it up--”\r\n\r\n“But it's the only way he can talk,” interrupted Janet. “He don't mean\r\nanything by it.”\r\n\r\nI sighed, yet set my face against weakness. “You see, Janet, people who\r\nswear do go there.”\r\n\r\nBut Janet would not believe.\r\n\r\n“God send my dear, kind father to hell just because he can't talk like\r\nthe gentlefolks! Don't you believe it of Him, Master Paul. He's got more\r\nsense.”\r\n\r\nI hope I pain no one by quoting Janet's common sense. For that I should\r\nbe sorry. I remember her words because so often, when sinking in sloughs\r\nof childish despond, they afforded me firm foothold. More often than\r\nI can tell, when compelled to listen to the sententious voice of\r\nimmeasurable Folly glibly explaining the eternal mysteries, has it\r\ncomforted me to whisper to myself: “I don't believe it of Him. He's got\r\nmore sense.”\r\n\r\nAnd about that period I had need of all the comfort I could get. As\r\nwe descend the road of life, the journey, demanding so much of our\r\nattention, becomes of more importance than the journey's end; but to the\r\nchild, standing at the valley's gate, the terminating hills are\r\nclearly visible. What lies beyond them is his constant wonder. I never\r\nquestioned my parents directly on the subject, shrinking as so strangely\r\nwe all do, both young and old, from discussion of the very matters\r\nof most moment to us; and they, on their part, not guessing my need,\r\ncontented themselves with the vague generalities with which we seek\r\nto hide even from ourselves the poverty of our beliefs. But there were\r\nfoolish voices about me less reticent; while the literature, illustrated\r\nand otherwise, provided in those days for serious-minded youth, answered\r\nall questionings with blunt brutality. If you did wrong you burnt in a\r\nfiery furnace for ever and ever. Were your imagination weak you could\r\nturn to the accompanying illustration, and see at a glance how you\r\nyourself would writhe and shrink and scream, while cheerful devils, well\r\norganised, were busy stoking. I had been burnt once, rather badly, in\r\nconsequence of live coals, in course of transit on a shovel, being let\r\nfall upon me. I imagined these burning coals, not confined to a mere\r\npart of my body, but pressing upon me everywhere, not snatched swiftly\r\noff by loving hands, the pain assuaged by applications of soft soap and\r\nthe blue bag, but left there, eating into my flesh and veins. And this\r\ncontinued for eternity. You suffered for an hour, a day, a thousand\r\nyears, and were no nearer to the end; ten thousand, a million years, and\r\nyet, as at the very first, it was for ever, and for ever still it would\r\nalways be for ever! I suffered also from insomnia about this period.\r\n\r\n“Then be good,” replied the foolish voices round me; “never do wrong,\r\nand so avoid this endless agony.”\r\n\r\nBut it was so easy to do wrong. There were so many wrong things to do,\r\nand the doing of them was so natural.\r\n\r\n“Then repent,” said the voices, always ready.\r\n\r\nBut how did one repent? What was repentance? Did I “hate my sin,” as I\r\nwas instructed I must, or merely hate the idea of going to hell for\r\nit? Because the latter, even my child's sense told me, was no true\r\nrepentance. Yet how could one know the difference?\r\n\r\nAbove all else there haunted me the fear of the “Unforgivable Sin.” What\r\nthis was I was never able to discover. I dreaded to enquire too closely,\r\nlest I should find I had committed it. Day and night the terror of it\r\nclung to me.\r\n\r\n“Believe,” said the voices; “so only shall you be saved.” How believe?\r\nHow know you did believe? Hours would I kneel in the dark, repeating in\r\na whispered scream:\r\n\r\n“I believe, I believe. Oh, I do believe!” and then rise with white\r\nknuckles, wondering if I really did believe.\r\n\r\nAnother question rose to trouble me. In the course of my meanderings I\r\nhad made the acquaintance of an old sailor, one of the most disreputable\r\nspecimens possible to find; and had learned to love him. Our first\r\nmeeting had been outside a confectioner's window, in the Commercial\r\nRoad, where he had discovered me standing, my nose against the glass, a\r\nmere palpitating Appetite on legs. He had seized me by the collar, and\r\nhauled me into the shop. There, dropping me upon a stool, he bade me\r\neat. Pride of race prompted me politely to decline, but his language\r\nbecame so awful that in fear and trembling I obeyed. So soon as I was\r\nfinished--it cost him two and fourpence, I remember--we walked down to\r\nthe docks together, and he told me stories of the sea and land that made\r\nmy blood run cold. Altogether, in the course of three weeks or a month,\r\nwe met about half a dozen times, when much the same programme was gone\r\nthrough. I think I was a fairly frank child, but I said nothing about\r\nhim at home, feeling instinctively that if I did there would be an end\r\nof our comradeship, which was dear to me: not merely by reason of\r\nthe pastry, though I admit that was a consideration, but also for his\r\nwondrous tales. I believed them all implicitly, and so came to regard\r\nhim as one of the most interesting criminals as yet unhanged: and what\r\nwas sad about the case, as I felt myself, was that his recital of his\r\nmany iniquities, instead of repelling, attracted me to him. If ever\r\nthere existed a sinner, here was one. He chewed tobacco--one of the\r\nhundred or so deadly sins, according to my theological library--and was\r\ngenerally more or less drunk. Not that a stranger would have\r\nnoticed this; the only difference being that when sober he appeared\r\nconstrained--was less his natural, genial self. In a burst of confidence\r\nhe once admitted to me that he was the biggest blackguard in the\r\nmerchant service. Unacquainted with the merchant service, as at the time\r\nI was, I saw no reason to doubt him.\r\n\r\nOne night in a state of intoxication he walked over a gangway and was\r\ndrowned. Our mutual friend, the confectioner, seeing me pass the window,\r\ncame out to tell me so; and having heard, I walked on, heavy of heart,\r\nand pondering.\r\n\r\nAbout his eternal destination there could be no question. The known\r\nfacts precluded the least ray of hope. How could I be happy in heaven,\r\nsupposing I eventually did succeed in slipping in, knowing that he, the\r\nlovable old scamp, was burning for ever in hell?\r\n\r\nHow could Janet, taking it that she reformed and thus escaped damnation,\r\nbe contented, knowing the father she loved doomed to torment? The\r\nheavenly hosts, so I argued, could be composed only of", " could be no question. The known\r\nfacts precluded the least ray of hope.

The\r\nheavenly hosts, so I argued, could be composed only of the callous and\r\nindifferent.\r\n\r\nI wondered how people could go about their business, eat, drink and\r\nbe merry, with tremendous fate hanging thus ever suspended over their\r\nheads. When for a little space I myself forgot it, always it fell back\r\nupon me with increased weight.\r\n\r\nNor was the contemplation of heaven itself particularly attractive to\r\nme, for it was a foolish paradise these foolish voices had fashioned out\r\nof their folly. You stood about and sang hymns--for ever! I was assured\r\nthat my fear of finding the programme monotonous was due only to my\r\nstate of original sin, that when I got there I should discover I liked\r\nit. But I would have given much for the hope of avoiding both their\r\nheaven and their hell.\r\n\r\nFortunately for my sanity I was not left long to brood unoccupied upon\r\nsuch themes. Our worldly affairs, under the sunshine of old Hasluck's\r\nround red face, prospered--for awhile; and one afternoon my father, who\r\nhad been away from home since breakfast time, calling me into his office\r\nwhere also sat my mother, informed me that the long-talked-of school was\r\nbecome at last a concrete thing.\r\n\r\n“The term commences next week,” explained my father. “It is not exactly\r\nwhat I had intended, but it will do--for the present. Later, of course,\r\nyou will go to one of the big public schools; your mother and I have not\r\nyet quite decided which.”\r\n\r\n“You will meet other boys there, good and bad,” said my mother, who\r\nsat clasping and unclasping her hands. “Be very careful, dear, how you\r\nchoose your companions.”\r\n\r\n“You will learn to take your own part,” said my father. “School is an\r\nepitome of the world. One must assert oneself, or one is sat upon.”\r\n\r\nI knew not what to reply, the vista thus opened out to me was so\r\nunexpected. My blood rejoiced, but my heart sank.\r\n\r\n“Take one of your long walks,” said my father, smiling, “and think it\r\nover.”\r\n\r\n“And if you are in any doubt, you know where to go for guidance, don't\r\nyou?” whispered my mother, who was very grave.\r\n\r\nYet I went to bed, dreaming of quite other things that night: of\r\nQueens of Beauty bending down to crown my brows with laurel: of wronged\r\nPrincesses for whose cause I rode to death or victory. For on my\r\nreturn home, being called into the drawing-room by my father, I stood\r\ntransfixed, my cap in hand, staring with all my eyes at the vision that\r\nI saw.\r\n\r\nNo such wonder had I ever seen before, at all events, not to my\r\nremembrance. The maidens that one meets in Poplar streets may be fair\r\nenough in their way, but their millinery displays them not to advantage;\r\nand the few lady visitors that came to us were of a staid and matronly\r\nappearance. Only out of pictures hitherto had such witchery looked upon\r\nme; and from these the spell faded as one gazed.\r\n\r\nI heard old Hasluck's smoky voice saying, “My little gell, Barbara,” and\r\nI went nearer to her, moving unconsciously.\r\n\r\n“You can kiss 'er,” said the smoky voice again; “she won't bite.” But I\r\ndid not kiss her. Nor ever felt I wanted to, upon the mouth.\r\n\r\nI suppose she must have been about fourteen, and I a little over ten,\r\nthough tall for my age. Later I came to know she had that rare gold\r\nhair that holds the light, so that upon her face, which seemed of dainty\r\nporcelain, there ever fell a softened radiance as from some shining\r\naureole; those blue eyes where dwell mysteries, shadow veiled. At the\r\ntime I knew nothing, but that it seemed to me as though the fairy-tales\r\nhad all come true.\r\n\r\nShe smiled, understanding and well pleased with my confusion. Child\r\nthough I was--little more than child though she was, it flattered her\r\nvanity.\r\n\r\nFair and sweet, you had but that one fault. Would it had been another,\r\nless cruel to you yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nIN WHICH THERE COMES BY ONE BENT UPON PURSUING HIS OWN WAY.\r\n\r\n“Correct” is, I think, the adjective by which I can best describe\r\nDoctor Florret and all his attributes. He was a large man, but not\r\ntoo large--just the size one would select for the head-master of an\r\nimportant middle-class school; stout, not fat, suggesting comfort, not\r\ngrossness. His hands were white and well shaped. On the left he wore\r\na fine diamond ring, but it shone rather than sparkled. He spoke of\r\ncommonplace things in a voice that lent dignity even to the weather. His\r\nface, which was clean-shaven, radiated benignity tempered by discretion.\r\n\r\nSo likewise all about him: his wife, the feminine counterpart of\r\nhimself. Seeing them side by side one felt tempted to believe that\r\nfor his special benefit original methods had been reverted to, and she\r\nfashioned, as his particular helpmeet, out of one of his own ribs.\r\nHis furniture was solid, meant for use, not decoration. His pictures,\r\nfollowing the rule laid down for dress, graced without drawing attention\r\nto his walls. He ever said the correct thing at the correct time in the\r\ncorrect manner. Doubtful of the correct thing to do, one could always\r\nlearn it by waiting till he did it; when one at once felt that nothing\r\nelse could possibly have been correct. He held on all matters\r\nthe correct views. To differ from him was to discover oneself a\r\nrevolutionary.\r\n\r\nIn practice, as I learned at the cost of four more or less wasted\r\nyears, he of course followed the methods considered correct by English\r\nschoolmen from the days of Edward VI. onwards.\r\n\r\nHeaven knows I worked hard. I wanted to learn. Ambition--the all\r\ncontaining ambition of a boy that “has its centre everywhere nor cares\r\nto fix itself to form” stirred within me. Did I pass a speaker at some\r\ncorner, hatless, perspiring, pointing Utopias in the air to restless\r\nhungry eyes, at once I saw myself, a Demosthenes swaying multitudes, a\r\nstatesman holding the House of Commons spellbound, the Prime Minister of\r\nEngland, worshipped by the entire country. Even the Opposition papers,\r\nhad I known of them, I should have imagined forced to reluctant\r\nadmiration. Did the echo of a distant drum fall upon my ear, then before\r\nme rose picturesque fields of carnage, one figure ever conspicuous:\r\nMyself, well to the front, isolated. Promotion in the British army of\r\nmy dream being a matter purely of merit, I returned Commander-in-Chief.\r\nVast crowds thronged every flag-decked street. I saw white waving hands\r\nfrom every roof and window. I heard the dull, deep roar of welcome, as\r\nwith superb seat upon my snow-white charger--or should it be coal-black?\r\nThe point cost me much consideration, so anxious was I that the day\r\nshould be without a flaw--I slowly paced at the head of my victorious\r\ntroops, between wild waves of upturned faces: walked into a lamp-post\r\nor on to the toes of some irascible old gentleman, and awoke. A drunken\r\nsailor stormed from between swing doors and tacked tumultuously down the\r\nstreet: the factory chimney belching smoke became a swaying mast. The\r\ncosters round about me shouted “Ay, ay, sir. 'Ready, ay, ready.” I\r\nwas Christopher Columbus, Drake, Nelson, rolled into one. Spurning\r\nthe presumption of modern geographers, I discovered new continents.\r\nI defeated the French--those useful French! I died in the moment of\r\nvictory. A nation mourned me and I was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\nAlso I lived and was created a Duke. Either alternative had its charm:\r\nperson", ". The\r\ncosters round about me shouted “Ay, ay, sir. 'Ready, ay, ready.” I\r\nwas Christopher Columbus, Drake, Nelson, rolled into one. Spurning\r\nthe presumption of modern geographers, I discovered new continents.\r\nI defeated the French--those useful French! I died in the moment of\r\nvictory. A nation mourned me and I was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\nAlso I lived and was created a Duke. Either alternative had its charm:\r\npersonally I was indifferent. Boys who on November the ninth, as\r\nexplained by letters from their mothers, read by Doctor Florret with a\r\nsnort, were suffering from a severe toothache, told me on November\r\nthe tenth of the glories of Lord Mayor's Shows. I heard their chatter\r\nfainter and fainter as from an ever-increasing distance. The bells of\r\nBow were ringing in my ears. I saw myself a merchant prince, though\r\nstill young. Nobles crowded my counting house. I lent them millions\r\nand married their daughters. I listened, unobserved in a corner, to\r\ndiscussion on some new book. Immediately I was a famous author. All men\r\npraised me: for of reviewers and their density I, in those days, knew\r\nnothing. Poetry, fiction, history, I wrote them all; and all men read,\r\nand wondered. Only here was a crumpled rose leaf in the pillow on which\r\nI laid my swelling head: penmanship was vexation to me, and spelling\r\npuzzled me, so that I wrote with sorrow and many blots and scratchings\r\nout. Almost I put aside the idea of becoming an author.\r\n\r\nBut along whichever road I might fight my way to the Elysian Fields\r\nof fame, education, I dimly but most certainly comprehended, was a\r\nnecessary weapon to my hand. And so, with aching heart and aching head,\r\nI pored over my many books. I see myself now in my small bedroom, my\r\nelbows planted on the shaky, one-legged table, startled every now and\r\nagain by the frizzling of my hair coming in contact with the solitary\r\ncandle. On cold nights I wear my overcoat, turned up about the neck, a\r\nblanket round my legs, and often I must sit with my fingers in my ears,\r\nthe better to shut out the sounds of life, rising importunately from\r\nbelow. “A song, Of a song, To a song, A song, O! song!” “I love, Thou\r\nlovest, He she or it loves. I should or would love” over and over again,\r\ntill my own voice seems some strange buzzing thing about me, while\r\nmy head grows smaller and smaller till I put my hands up frightened,\r\nwondering if it still be entire upon my shoulders.\r\n\r\nWas I more stupid than the average, or is a boy's brain physically\r\nincapable of the work our educational system demands of it?\r\n\r\n“Latin and Greek” I hear repeating the suave tones of Doctor Florret,\r\nechoing as ever the solemn croak of Correctness, “are useful as mental\r\ngymnastics.” My dear Doctor Florret and Co., cannot you, out of the vast\r\nstorehouse of really necessary knowledge, select apparatus better fitted\r\nto strengthen and not overstrain the mental muscles of ten-to-fourteen?\r\nYou, gentle reader, with brain fully grown, trained by years of practice\r\nto its subtlest uses, take me from your bookshelf, say, your Browning or\r\neven your Shakespeare. Come, you know this language well. You have not\r\nmerely learned: it is your mother tongue. Construe for me this short\r\npassage, these few verses: parse, analyse, resolve into component parts!\r\nAnd now, will you maintain that it is good for Tommy, tear-stained,\r\nink-bespattered little brat, to be given AEsop's Fables, Ovid's\r\nMetamorphoses to treat in like manner? Would it not be just as sensible\r\nto insist upon his practising his skinny little arms with hundred pounds\r\ndumb-bells?\r\n\r\nWe were the sons of City men, of not well-to-do professional men, of\r\nminor officials, clerks, shopkeepers, our roads leading through the\r\nworkaday world. Yet quite half our time was taken up in studies utterly\r\nuseless to us. How I hated them, these youth-tormenting Shades. Homer!\r\nhow I wished the fishermen had asked him that absurd riddle earlier.\r\nHorace! why could not that shipwreck have succeeded: it would have in\r\nthe case of any one but a classic.\r\n\r\nUntil one blessed day there fell into my hands a wondrous talisman.\r\n\r\nHearken unto me, ye heavy burdened little brethren of mine. Waste not\r\nyour substance upon tops and marbles, nor yet upon tuck (Do ye still\r\ncall it “tuck”?), but scrape and save. For in the neighbourhood of\r\nPaternoster Row there dwells a good magician who for silver will provide\r\nyou with a “Key” that shall open wide for you the gates of Hades.\r\n\r\nBy its aid, the Frogs of Aristophanes became my merry friends. With\r\nUlysses I wandered eagerly through Wonderland. Doctor Florret was\r\ncharmed with my progress, which was real, for now, at last, I was\r\nstudying according to the laws of common sense, understanding first,\r\nexplaining afterwards. Let Youth, that the folly of Age would imprison\r\nin ignorance, provide itself with “Keys.”\r\n\r\nBut let me not seem to claim credit due to another. Dan it was--Dan of\r\nthe strong arm and the soft smile, Dan the wise hater of all useless\r\nlabour, sharp-witted, easy-going Dan, who made this grand discovery.\r\n\r\nDan followed me a term later into the Lower Fourth, but before he had\r\nbeen there a week was handling Latin verse with an ease and dexterity\r\nsuggestive of unholy dealings with the Devil. In a lonely corner of\r\nRegent's Park, first making sure no one was within earshot, he revealed\r\nto me his magic.\r\n\r\n“Don't tell the others,” he commanded; “or it will get out, and then\r\nnobody will be any the better.”\r\n\r\n“But is it right?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Look here, young 'un,” said Dan; “what are you here for--what's\r\nyour father paying school fees for (it was the appeal to our\r\nconscientiousness most often employed by Dr. Florret himself), for you\r\nto play a silly game, or to learn something?\r\n\r\n“Because if it's only a game--we boys against the masters,” continued\r\nDan, “then let's play according to rule. If we're here to learn--well,\r\nyou've been in the class four months and I've just come, and I bet I\r\nknow more Ovid than you do already.” Which was true.\r\n\r\nSo I thanked Dan and shared with him his key; and all the Latin I\r\nremember, for whatever good it may be to me, I take it I owe to him.\r\n\r\nAnd knowledge of yet greater value do I owe to the good fortune that\r\nhis sound mother wit was ever at my disposal to correct my dreamy\r\nunfeasibility; for from first to last he was my friend; and to have\r\nbeen the chosen friend of Dan, shrewd judge of man and boy, I deem no\r\nunimportant feather in my cap. He “took to” me, he said, because I was\r\nso “jolly green”--“such a rummy little mug.” No other reason would he\r\never give me, save only a sweet smile and a tumbling of my hair with his\r\ngreat hand; but I think I understood. And I loved him because he was\r\nbig and strong and handsome and kind; no one but a little boy knows\r\nhow brutal or how kind a big boy can be. I was still somewhat of an\r\neffeminate little chap, nervous and shy, with a pink and white face, and\r\nhair that no amount of wetting would make straight. I was growing too\r\nfast, which took what strength I had, and my journey every day, added\r\nto school work and home work, maybe was too much for my years. Every\r\nmorning I had to be up at six, leaving the house before seven to catch\r\nthe seven fifteen from Poplar station; and from Chalk Farm I had to walk\r\nyet another couple of miles. But that I did not mind, for at Chalk Farm\r\nstation", "ting would make straight.

But that I did not mind, for at Chalk Farm\r\nstation Dan was always waiting for me. In the afternoon we walked back\r\ntogether also; and when I was tired and my back ached--just as if some\r\none had cut a piece out of it, I felt--he would put his arm round\r\nme, for he always knew, and oh, how strong and restful it was to lean\r\nagainst, so that one walked as in an easy-chair.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, remembering how I would walk thus by his side, looking\r\nup shyly into his face, thinking how strong and good he was, feeling so\r\nglad he liked me, I can understand a little how a woman loves. He was so\r\nsolid. With his arm round me, it was good to feel weak.\r\n\r\nAt first we were in the same class, the Lower Third. He had no business\r\nthere. He was head and shoulders taller than any of us and years older.\r\nIt was a disgrace to him that he was not in the Upper Fourth. The Doctor\r\nwould tell him so before us all twenty times a week. Old Waterhouse\r\n(I call him “Old Waterhouse” because “Mister Waterhouse, M.A.,”\r\n would convey no meaning to me, and I should not know about whom I\r\nwas speaking) who cordially liked him, was honestly grieved. We, his\r\nfriends, though it was pleasant to have him among us, suffered in our\r\npride of him. The only person quite contented was Dan himself. It was\r\nhis way in all things. Others had their opinion of what was good\r\nfor him. He had his own, and his own was the only opinion that ever\r\ninfluenced him. The Lower Third suited him. For him personally the Upper\r\nFourth had no attraction.\r\n\r\nAnd even in the Lower Third he was always at the bottom. He preferred\r\nit. He selected the seat and kept it, in spite of all allurements, in\r\nspite of all reproaches. It was nearest to the door. It enabled him\r\nto be first out and last in. Also it afforded a certain sense of\r\nretirement. Its occupant, to an extent screened from observation,\r\nbecame in the course of time almost forgotten. To Dan's philosophical\r\ntemperament its practical advantages outweighed all sentimental\r\nobjection.\r\n\r\nOnly on one occasion do I remember his losing it. As a rule, tiresome\r\nquestions, concerning past participles, square roots, or meridians never\r\nreached him, being snapped up in transit by arm-waving lovers of such\r\ntrifles. The few that by chance trickled so far he took no notice of.\r\nThey possessed no interest for him, and he never pretended that they\r\ndid. But one day, taken off his guard, he gave voice quite unconsciously\r\nto a correct reply, with the immediate result of finding himself in an\r\nexposed position on the front bench. I had never seen Dan out of\r\ntemper before, but that moment had any of us ventured upon a whispered\r\ncongratulation we would have had our head punched, I feel confident.\r\n\r\nOld Waterhouse thought that here at last was reformation. “Come, Brian,”\r\nhe cried, rubbing his long thin hands together with delight, “after all,\r\nyou're not such a fool as you pretend.”\r\n\r\n“Never said I was,” muttered Dan to himself, with a backward glance of\r\nregret towards his lost seclusion; and before the day was out he had\r\nworked his way back to it again.\r\n\r\nAs we were going out together, old Waterhouse passed us on the stairs:\r\n“Haven't you any sense of shame, my boy?” he asked sorrowfully, laying\r\nhis hand kindly on Dan's shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” answered Dan, with his frank smile; “plenty. It isn't yours,\r\nthat's all.”\r\n\r\nHe was an excellent fighter. In the whole school of over two hundred\r\nboys, not half a dozen, and those only Upper Sixth boys--fellows who\r\ncame in top hats with umbrellas, and who wouldn't out of regard to their\r\nown dignity--could have challenged him with any chance of success. Yet\r\nhe fought very seldom, and then always in a bored, lazy fashion, as\r\nthough he were doing it purely to oblige the other fellow.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, just as we were about to enter Regent's Park by the\r\nwicket opposite Hanover Gate, a biggish boy, an errand boy carrying an\r\nempty basket, and supported by two smaller boys, barred our way.\r\n\r\n“Can't come in here,” said the boy with the basket.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” inquired Dan.\r\n\r\n“'Cos if you do I shall kick you,” was the simple explanation.\r\n\r\nWithout a word Dan turned away, prepared to walk on to the next opening.\r\nThe boy with the basket, evidently encouraged, followed us: “Now, I'm\r\ngoing to give you your coward's blow,” he said, stepping in front of us;\r\n“will you take it quietly?” It is a lonely way, the Outer Circle, on a\r\nwinter's afternoon.\r\n\r\n“I'll tell you afterwards,” said Dan, stopping short.\r\n\r\nThe boy gave him a slight slap on the cheek. It could not have hurt, but\r\nthe indignity, of course, was great. No boy of honour, according to our\r\ncode, could have accepted it without retaliating.\r\n\r\n“Is that all?” asked Dan.\r\n\r\n“That's all--for the present,” replied the boy with the basket.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” said Dan, and walked on.\r\n\r\n“Glad he didn't insist on fighting,” remarked Dan, cheerfully, as we\r\nproceeded; “I'm going to a party tonight.”\r\n\r\nYet on another occasion, in a street off Lisson Grove, he insisted\r\non fighting a young rough half again his own weight, who, brushing up\r\nagainst him, had knocked his hat off into the mud.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn't have said anything about his knocking it off,” explained\r\nDan afterwards, tenderly brushing the poor bruised thing with his coat\r\nsleeve, “if he hadn't kicked it.”\r\n\r\nOn another occasion I remember, three or four of us, Dan among the\r\nnumber, were on our way one broiling summer's afternoon to Hadley Woods.\r\nAs we turned off from the highroad just beyond Barnet and struck into\r\nthe fields, Dan drew from his pocket an enormous juicy-looking pear.\r\n\r\n“Where did you get that from?” inquired one, Dudley.\r\n\r\n“From that big greengrocer's opposite Barnet Church,” answered Dan.\r\n“Have a bit?”\r\n\r\n“You told me you hadn't any more money,” retorted Dudley, in reproachful\r\ntones.\r\n\r\n“No more I had,” replied Dan, holding out a tempting slice at the end of\r\nhis pocket-knife.\r\n\r\n“You must have had some, or you couldn't have bought that pear,” argued\r\nDudley, accepting.\r\n\r\n“Didn't buy it.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say you stole it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You're a thief,” denounced Dudley, wiping his mouth and throwing away a\r\npip.\r\n\r\n“I know it. So are you.”\r\n\r\n“No, I'm not.”\r\n\r\n“What's the good of talking nonsense. You robbed an orchard only last\r\nWednesday at Mill Hill, and gave yourself the stomach-ache.”\r\n\r\n“That isn't stealing.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“It isn't the same thing.”\r\n\r\n“What's the difference?”\r\n\r\nAnd nothing could make Dan comprehend the difference. “Stealing is\r\nstealing,” he would have it, “whether you take it off a tree or out of a\r\nbasket. You're a thief, Dudley; so am I. Anybody else say a piece?”\r\n\r\nThe thermometer was at that point where morals become slack. We all had\r\na piece; but we were all of us shocked at Dan, and told him so. It did\r\nnot agitate him in the least.\r\n\r\nTo Dan I could speak my inmost thoughts, knowing he would understand me,\r\nand sometimes from him I received assistance and sometimes confusion.\r\nThe yearly examination was approaching. My father and mother said\r\nnothing, but I knew how anxiously each", " Anybody else say a piece?”\r\n\r\nThe thermometer was at that point where morals become slack. We all had\r\na piece; but we were all of us shocked at Dan, and told him so. It did\r\nnot agitate him in the least.\r\n\r\nTo Dan I could speak my inmost thoughts, knowing he would understand me,\r\nand sometimes from him I received assistance and sometimes confusion.\r\nThe yearly examination was approaching. My father and mother said\r\nnothing, but I knew how anxiously each of them awaited the result; my\r\nfather, to see how much I had accomplished; my mother, how much I had\r\nendeavoured. I had worked hard, but was doubtful, knowing that prizes\r\ndepend less upon what you know than upon what you can make others\r\nbelieve you know; which applies to prizes beyond those of school.\r\n\r\n“Are you going in for anything, Dan?” I asked him. We were discussing\r\nthe subject, crossing Primrose Hill, one bright June morning.\r\n\r\nI knew the question absurd. I asked it of him because I wanted him to\r\nask it of me.\r\n\r\n“They're not giving away anything I particularly want,” murmured Dan, in\r\nhis lazy drawl: looked at from that point of view, school prizes are, it\r\nmust be confessed, not worth their cost.\r\n\r\n“You're sweating yourself, young 'un, of course?” he asked next, as I\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n“I mean to have a shot at the History,” I admitted. “Wish I was better\r\nat dates.”\r\n\r\n“It's always two-thirds dates,” Dan assured me, to my discouragement.\r\n“Old Florret thinks you can't eat a potato until you know the date that\r\nchap Raleigh was born.”\r\n\r\n“I've prayed so hard that I may win the History prize,” I explained to\r\nhim. I never felt shy with Dan. He never laughed at me.\r\n\r\n“You oughtn't to have done that,” he said. I stared. “It isn't fair to\r\nthe other fellows. That won't be your winning the prize; that will be\r\nyour getting it through favouritism.”\r\n\r\n“But they can pray, too,” I reminded him.\r\n\r\n“If you all pray for it,” answered Dan, “then it will go, not to the\r\nfellow that knows most history, but to the fellow that's prayed the\r\nhardest. That isn't old Florret's idea, I'm sure.”\r\n\r\n“But we are told to pray for things we want,” I insisted.\r\n\r\n“Beastly mean way of getting 'em,” retorted Dan. And no argument that\r\ncame to me, neither then nor at any future time, brought him to right\r\nthinking on this point.\r\n\r\nHe would judge all matters for himself. In his opinion Achilles was a\r\ncoward, not a hero.\r\n\r\n“He ought to have told the Trojans that they couldn't hurt any part of\r\nhim except his heel, and let them have a shot at that,” he argued;\r\n“King Arthur and all the rest of them with their magic swords, it wasn't\r\nplaying the game. There's no pluck in fighting if you know you're bound\r\nto win. Beastly cads, I call them all.”\r\n\r\nI won no prize that year. Oddly enough, Dan did, for arithmetic; the\r\nonly subject studied in the Lower Fourth that interested him. He liked\r\nto see things coming right, he explained.\r\n\r\nMy father shut himself up with me for half an hour and examined me\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“It's very curious, Paul,” he said, “you seem to know a good deal.”\r\n\r\n“They asked me all the things I didn't know. They seemed to do it on\r\npurpose,” I blurted out, and laid my head upon my arm. My father crossed\r\nthe room and sat down beside me.\r\n\r\n“Spud!” he said--it was a long time since he had called me by that\r\nchildish nickname--“perhaps you are going to be with me, one of the\r\nunlucky ones.”\r\n\r\n“Are you unlucky?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Invariably,” answered my father, rumpling his hair. “I don't know why.\r\nI try hard--I do the right thing, but it turns out wrong. It always\r\ndoes.”\r\n\r\n“But I thought Mr. Hasluck was bringing us such good fortune,” I said,\r\nlooking up in surprise. “We're getting on, aren't we?”\r\n\r\n“I have thought so before, so often,” said my father, “and it has always\r\nended in a--in a collapse.”\r\n\r\nI put my arms round his neck, for I always felt to my father as to\r\nanother boy; bigger than myself and older, but not so very much.\r\n\r\n“You see, when I married your mother,” he went on, “I was a rich man.\r\nShe had everything she wanted.”\r\n\r\n“But you will get it all back,” I cried.\r\n\r\n“I try to think so,” he answered. “I do think so--generally speaking.\r\nBut there are times--you would not understand--they come to you.”\r\n\r\n“But she is happy,” I persisted; “we are all happy.”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I watch her,” he said. “Women suffer more than we do. They live more\r\nin the present. I see my hopes, but she--she sees only me, and I have\r\nalways been a failure. She has lost faith in me.”\r\n\r\nI could say nothing. I understood but dimly.\r\n\r\n“That is why I want you to be an educated man, Paul,” he continued after\r\na silence. “You can't think what a help education is to a man. I don't\r\nmean it helps you to get on in the world; I think for that it rather\r\nhampers you. But it helps you to bear adversity. To a man with a\r\nwell-stored mind, life is interesting on a piece of bread and a cup\r\nof tea. I know. If it were not for you and your mother I should not\r\ntrouble.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet at that time our fortunes were at their brightest, so far as I\r\nremember them; and when they were dark again he was full of fresh hope,\r\nplanning, scheming, dreaming again. It was never acting. A worse actor\r\nnever trod this stage on which we fret. His occasional attempts at a\r\ncheerfulness he did not feel inevitably resulted in our all three crying\r\nin one another's arms. No; it was only when things were going well\r\nthat experience came to his injury. Child of misfortune, he ever rose,\r\nAntaeus-like, renewed in strength from contact with his mother.\r\n\r\nNor must it be understood that his despondent moods, even in time of\r\nprosperity, were oft recurring. Generally speaking, as he himself said,\r\nhe was full of confidence. Already had he fixed upon our new house in\r\nGuilford Street, then still a good residential quarter; while at the\r\nsame time, as he would explain to my mother, sufficiently central for\r\noffice purposes, close as it was to Lincoln and Grey's Inn and Bedford\r\nRow, pavements long worn with the weary footsteps of the Law's sad\r\ncourtiers.\r\n\r\n“Poplar,” said my father, “has disappointed me. It seemed a good idea--a\r\nrapidly rising district, singularly destitute of solicitors. It ought to\r\nhave turned out well, and yet somehow it hasn't.”\r\n\r\n“There have been a few come,” my mother reminded him.\r\n\r\n“Of a sort,” admitted my father; “a criminal lawyer might gather\r\nsomething of a practice here, I have no doubt. But for general work,\r\nof course, you must be in a central position. Now, in Guilford Street\r\npeople will come to me.”\r\n\r\n“It should certainly be a pleasanter neighbourhood to live in,” agreed\r\nmy mother.\r\n\r\n“Later on,” said my father, “in case I want the whole house for offices,\r\nwe could live ourselves in Regent's Park. It is quite near to the Park.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you have consulted Mr. Hasluck?” asked my mother, who of the\r\ntwo was by far the more practical.\r\n\r\n“For Hasluck,” replied my father, “it will be much more convenient. He\r\ngrumbles every time at the distance.”\r\n\r\n“I have never been quite able to understand,” said my mother, “why Mr.\r\nHasluck should have come so far out of his way. There must surely be\r\nplenty of solicitors in the City.”\r\n\r\n“He had heard of me,” explained my father. “A curious old\r\nfellow--likes his own way of doing things. It's not everyone who would\r\n", " replied my father, “it will be much more convenient. He\r\ngrumbles every time at the distance.”\r\n\r\n“I have never been quite able to understand,” said my mother, “why Mr.\r\nHasluck should have come so far out of his way. There must surely be\r\nplenty of solicitors in the City.”\r\n\r\n“He had heard of me,” explained my father. “A curious old\r\nfellow--likes his own way of doing things. It's not everyone who would\r\ncare for him as a client. But I seem able to manage him.”\r\n\r\nOften we would go together, my father and I, to Guilford Street. It was\r\na large corner house that had taken his fancy, half creeper covered,\r\nwith a balcony, and pleasantly situated, overlooking the gardens of the\r\nFoundling Hospital. The wizened old caretaker knew us well, and having\r\nopened the door, would leave us to wander through the empty, echoing\r\nrooms at our own will. We furnished them handsomely in later Queen\r\nAnne style, of which my father was a connoisseur, sparing no necessary\r\nexpense; for, as my father observed, good furniture is always worth its\r\nprice, while to buy cheap is pure waste of money.\r\n\r\n“This,” said my father, on the second floor, stepping from the bedroom\r\ninto the smaller room adjoining, “I shall make your mother's boudoir.\r\nWe will have the walls in lavender and maple green--she is fond of soft\r\ntones--and the window looks out upon the gardens. There we will put her\r\nwriting-table.”\r\n\r\nMy own bedroom was on the third floor, a sunny little room.\r\n\r\n“You will be quiet here,” said my father, “and we can shut out the bed\r\nand the washstand with a screen.”\r\n\r\nLater, I came to occupy it; though its rent--eight and sixpence a week,\r\nincluding attendance--was somewhat more than at the time I ought to have\r\nafforded. Nevertheless, I adventured it, taking the opportunity of being\r\nan inmate of the house to refurnish it, unknown to my stout landlady, in\r\nlater Queen Anne style, putting a neat brass plate with my father's name\r\nupon the door. “Luke Kelver, Solicitor. Office hours, 10 till 4.” A\r\nmedical student thought he occupied my mother's boudoir. He was a dull\r\ndog, full of tiresome talk. But I made acquaintanceship with him; and\r\noften of an evening would smoke my pipe there in silence while\r\npretending to be listening to his monotonous brag.\r\n\r\nThe poor thing! he had no idea that he was only a foolish ghost;\r\nthat his walls, seemingly covered with coarse-coloured prints\r\nof wooden-looking horses, simpering ballet girls and petrified\r\nprize-fighters, were in reality a delicate tone of lavender and maple\r\ngreen; that at her writing-table in the sunlit window sat my mother, her\r\nsoft curls curtaining her quiet face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nOF THE SHADOW THAT CAME BETWEEN THE MAN IN GREY AND THE LADY OF THE\r\nLOVE-LIT EYES.\r\n\r\n“There's nothing missing,” said my mother, “so far as I can find out.\r\nDepend upon it, that's the explanation: she has got frightened and has\r\nrun away.\r\n\r\n“But what was there to frighten her?” said my father, pausing with a\r\ndecanter in one hand and the bottle in the other.\r\n\r\n“It was the idea of the thing,” replied my mother. “She has never been\r\nused to waiting at table. She was actually crying about it only last\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n“But what's to be done?” said my father. “They will be here in less than\r\nan hour.”\r\n\r\n“There will be no dinner for them,” said my mother, “unless I put on an\r\napron and bring it up myself.”\r\n\r\n“Where does she live?” asked my father.\r\n\r\n“At Ilford,” answered my mother.\r\n\r\n“We must make a joke of it,” said my father.\r\n\r\nMy mother, sitting down, began to cry. It had been a trying week for my\r\nmother. A party to dinner--to a real dinner, beginning with anchovies\r\nand ending with ices from the confectioner's; if only they would remain\r\nices and not, giving way to unaccustomed influences, present themselves\r\nas cold custard--was an extraordinary departure from the even tenor of\r\nour narrow domestic way; indeed, I recollect none previous. First there\r\nhad been the house to clean and rearrange almost from top to bottom;\r\nendless small purchases to be made of articles that Need never misses,\r\nbut which Ostentation, if ever you let her sneering nose inside the\r\ndoor, at once demands. Then the kitchen range--it goes without saying:\r\none might imagine them all members of a stove union, controlled by some\r\nagitating old boiler out of work--had taken the opportunity to strike,\r\nrefusing to bake another dish except under permanently improved\r\nconditions, necessitating weary days with plumbers. Fat cookery books,\r\nlong neglected on their shelf, had been consulted, argued with and\r\nabused; experiments made, failures sighed over, successes noted; cost\r\ncalculated anxiously; means and ways adjusted, hope finally achieved,\r\nshadowed by fear.\r\n\r\nAnd now with victory practically won, to have the reward thus dashed\r\nfrom her hand at the last moment! Downstairs in the kitchen would be\r\nthe dinner, waiting for the guests; upstairs round the glittering table\r\nwould be the assembled guests, waiting for their dinner. But between the\r\ntwo yawned an impassable gulf. The bridge, without a word of warning,\r\nhad bolted--was probably by this time well on its way to Ilford. There\r\nwas excuse for my mother's tears.\r\n\r\n“Isn't it possible to get somebody else?” asked my father.\r\n\r\n“Impossible, in the time,” said my mother. “I had been training her for\r\nthe whole week. We had rehearsed it perfectly.”\r\n\r\n“Have it in the kitchen,” suggested my aunt, who was folding napkins to\r\nlook like ships, which they didn't in the least, “and call it a picnic.”\r\n Really it seemed the only practical solution.\r\n\r\nThere came a light knock at the front door.\r\n\r\n“It can't be anybody yet, surely,” exclaimed my father in alarm, making\r\nfor his coat.\r\n\r\n“It's Barbara, I expect,” explained my mother. “She promised to come\r\nround and help me dress. But now, of course, I shan't want her.” My\r\nmother's nature was pessimistic.\r\n\r\nBut with the words Barbara ran into the room, for I had taken it upon\r\nmyself to admit her, knowing that shadows slipped out through the window\r\nwhen Barbara came in at the door--in those days, I mean.\r\n\r\nShe kissed them all three, though it seemed but one movement, she was so\r\nquick. And at once they saw the humour of the thing.\r\n\r\n“There's going to be no dinner,” laughed my father. “We are going to\r\nlook surprised and pretend that it was yesterday. It will be fun to see\r\ntheir faces.”\r\n\r\n“There will be a very nice dinner,” smiled my mother, “but it will be\r\nin the kitchen, and there's no way of getting it upstairs.” And they\r\nexplained to her the situation.\r\n\r\nShe stood for an instant, her sweet face the gravest in the group. Then\r\na light broke upon it.\r\n\r\n“I'll get you someone,” she said.\r\n\r\n“My dear, you don't even know the neighbourhood,” began my mother. But\r\nBarbara had snatched the latchkey from its nail and was gone.\r\n\r\nWith her disappearance, shadow fell again upon us. “If there were only\r\nan hotel in this beastly neighbourhood,” said my father.\r\n\r\n“You must entertain them by yourself, Luke,” said my mother; “and I must\r\nwait--that's all.”\r\n\r\n“Don't be absurd, Maggie,” cried my father, getting angry. “Can't cook\r\nbring it in?”\r\n\r\n“No one can cook a dinner and serve it, too,” answered my mother,\r\nimpatiently. “Besides, she's not presentable.”\r\n\r\n“What about Fan?” whispered my father.\r\n\r\nMy mother merely looked. It was sufficient.\r\n\r\n“Paul?” suggested my father.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” retorted my mother. “I don't choose to have my son turned\r\ninto a footman, if you do.”\r\n\r\n“Well, hadn't you better go and dress?” was my father's next remark.\r\n\r\n“It won't take me long to put on an apron", " my mother,\r\nimpatiently. “Besides, she's not presentable.”\r\n\r\n“What about Fan?” whispered my father.\r\n\r\nMy mother merely looked. It was sufficient.\r\n\r\n“Paul?” suggested my father.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” retorted my mother. “I don't choose to have my son turned\r\ninto a footman, if you do.”\r\n\r\n“Well, hadn't you better go and dress?” was my father's next remark.\r\n\r\n“It won't take me long to put on an apron,” was my mother's reply.\r\n\r\n“I was looking forward to seeing you in that new frock,” said my father.\r\nIn the case of another, one might have attributed such a speech to tact;\r\nin the case of my father, one felt it was a happy accident.\r\n\r\nMy mother confessed--speaking with a certain indulgence, as one does of\r\none's own follies when past--that she herself also had looked forward to\r\nseeing herself therein. Threatening discord melted into mutual sympathy.\r\n\r\n“I so wanted everything to be all right, for your sake, Luke,” said my\r\nmother; “I know you were hoping it would help on the business.”\r\n\r\n“I was only thinking of you, Maggie, dear,” answered my father. “You are\r\nmy business.”\r\n\r\n“I know, dear,” said my mother. “It is hard.”\r\n\r\nThe key turned in the lock, and we all stood quiet to listen.\r\n\r\n“She's come back alone,” said my mother. “I knew it was hopeless.”\r\n\r\nThe door opened.\r\n\r\n“Please, ma'am,” said the new parlour-maid, “will I do?”\r\n\r\nShe stood there, framed by the lintel, in the daintiest of aprons, the\r\ndaintiest of caps upon her golden hair; and every objection she swept\r\naside with the wind of her merry wilfulness. No one ever had their way\r\nwith her, nor wanted it.\r\n\r\n“You shall be footman,” she ordered, turning to me--but this time my\r\nmother only laughed. “Wait here till I come down again.” Then to my\r\nmother: “Now, ma'am, are you ready?”\r\n\r\nIt was the first time I had seen my mother, or, indeed, any other flesh\r\nand blood woman, in evening dress, and to tell the truth I was a little\r\nshocked. Nay, more than a little, and showed it, I suppose; for my\r\nmother flushed and drew her shawl over the gleaming whiteness of her\r\nshoulders, pleading coldness. But Barbara cried out against this, saying\r\nit was a sin such beauty should be hid; and my father, filching a shawl\r\nwith a quick hand, so dextrously indeed as to suggest some previous\r\npractice in the feat, dropped on one knee--as though the world were some\r\nsweet picture book--and raised my mother's hand with grave reverence to\r\nhis lips; and Barbara, standing behind my mother's chair, insisted on\r\nmy following suit, saying the Queen was receiving. So I knelt also,\r\nglancing up shyly as towards the gracious face of some fair lady\r\nhitherto unknown, thus Catching my first glimpse of the philosophy of\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nMy memory lingers upon this scene by contrast with the sad, changed\r\ndays that swiftly followed, when my mother's eyes would flash towards\r\nmy father angry gleams, and her voice ring cruel and hard; though the\r\nmoment he was gone her lips would tremble and her eyes grow soft again\r\nand fill with tears; when my father would sit with averted face and\r\nsullen lips tight pressed, or worse, would open them only to pour forth\r\na rapid flood of savage speech; and fling out of the room, slamming the\r\ndoor behind him, and I would find him hours afterwards, sitting alone in\r\nthe dark, with bowed head between his hands.\r\n\r\nWretched, I would lie awake, hearing through the flimsy walls their\r\npassionate tones, now rising high, now fiercely forced into cold\r\nwhispers; and then their words to each other sounded even crueller.\r\n\r\nIn their estrangement from each other, so new to them, both clung closer\r\nto me, though they would tell me nothing, nor should I have understood\r\nif they had. When my mother was sobbing softly, her arms clasping me\r\ntighter and tighter with each quivering throb, then I hated my father,\r\nwho I felt had inflicted this sorrow upon her. Yet when my father drew\r\nme down upon his knee, and I looked into his kind eyes so full of pain,\r\nthen I felt angry with my mother, remembering her bitter tongue.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me as though some cruel, unseen thing had crept into the\r\nhouse to stand ever between them, so that they might never look into\r\neach other's loving eyes but only into the eyes of this evil shadow. The\r\nidea grew upon me until at times I could almost detect its outline in\r\nthe air, feel a chillness as it passed me. It trod silently through the\r\npokey rooms, always alert to thrust its grinning face before them.\r\nNow beside my mother it would whisper in her ear; and the next moment,\r\nstealing across to my father, answer for him with his voice, but\r\nstrangely different. I used to think I could hear it laughing to itself\r\nas it stepped back into enfolding space.\r\n\r\nTo this day I seem to see it, ever following with noiseless footsteps\r\nman and woman, waiting patiently its opportunity to thrust its face\r\nbetween them. So that I can read no love tale, but, glancing round, I\r\nsee its mocking eyes behind my shoulder, reading also, with a silent\r\nlaugh. So that never can I meet with boy and girl, whispering in the\r\ntwilight, but I see it lurking amid the half lights, just behind them,\r\ncreeping after them with stealthy tread, as hand in hand they pass me in\r\nquiet ways.\r\n\r\nShall any of us escape, or lies the road of all through this dark\r\nvalley of the shadow of dead love? Is it Love's ordeal? testing the\r\nfeeble-hearted from the strong in faith, who shall find each other yet\r\nagain, the darkness passed?\r\n\r\nOf the dinner itself, until time of dessert, I can give no consecutive\r\naccount, for as footman, under the orders of this enthusiastic\r\nparlour-maid, my place was no sinecure, and but few opportunities of\r\nobservation through the crack of the door were afforded me. All that\r\nwas clear to me was that the chief guest was a Mr. Teidelmann--or\r\nTiedelmann, I cannot now remember which--a snuffy, mumbling old frump,\r\nwith whose name then, however, I was familiar by reason of seeing it\r\nso often in huge letters, though with a Co. added, on dreary long blank\r\nwalls, bordering the Limehouse reach. He sat at my mother's right hand;\r\nand I wondered, noticing him so ugly and so foolish seeming, how she\r\ncould be so interested in him, shouting much and often to him; for added\r\nto his other disattractions he was very deaf, which necessitated his\r\nputting his hand up to his ear at every other observation made to\r\nhim, crying querulously: “Eh, what? What are you talking about? Say it\r\nagain,”--smiling upon him and paying close attention to his every want.\r\nEven old Hasluck, opposite to him, and who, though pleasant enough\r\nin his careless way, was far from being a slave to politeness, roared\r\nhimself purple, praising some new disinfectant of which this same\r\nTeidelmann appeared to be the proprietor.\r\n\r\n“My wife swears by it,” bellowed Hasluck, leaning across the table.\r\n\r\n“Our drains!” chimed in Mrs. Hasluck, who was a homely soul; “well,\r\nyou'd hardly know there was any in the house since I've took to using\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“What are they talking about?” asked Teidelmann, appealing to my mother.\r\n“What's he say his wife does?”\r\n\r\n“Your disinfectant,” explained my mother; “Mrs. Hasluck swears by it.”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Hasluck.”\r\n\r\n“Does she? Delighted to hear it,” grunted the old gentleman, evidently\r\nbored.\r\n\r\n“Nothing like it for a sick-room,” persisted Hasluck; “might almost call\r\nit a scent.”\r\n\r\n“Makes one quite anxious to be ill,” remarked my aunt, addressing no one\r\nin particular.\r\n\r\n“Reminds me of", "Your disinfectant,” explained my mother; “Mrs. Hasluck swears by it.”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Hasluck.”\r\n\r\n“Does she? Delighted to hear it,” grunted the old gentleman, evidently\r\nbored.\r\n\r\n“Nothing like it for a sick-room,” persisted Hasluck; “might almost call\r\nit a scent.”\r\n\r\n“Makes one quite anxious to be ill,” remarked my aunt, addressing no one\r\nin particular.\r\n\r\n“Reminds me of cocoanuts,” continued Hasluck.\r\n\r\nIts proprietor appeared not to hear, but Hasluck was determined his\r\nflattery should not be lost.\r\n\r\n“I say it reminds me of cocoanuts.” He screamed it this time.\r\n\r\n“Oh, does it?” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“Doesn't it you?”\r\n\r\n“Can't say it does,” answered Teidelmann. “As a matter of fact, don't\r\nknow much about it myself. Never use it.”\r\n\r\nOld Teidelmann went on with his dinner, but Hasluck was still full of\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n“Take my advice,” he shouted, “and buy a bottle.”\r\n\r\n“Buy a what?”\r\n\r\n“A bottle,” roared the other, with an effort palpably beyond his\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n“What's he say? What's he talking about now?” asked Teidelmann, again\r\nappealing to my mother.\r\n\r\n“He says you ought to buy a bottle,” again explained my mother.\r\n\r\n“What of?”\r\n\r\n“Of your own disinfectant.”\r\n\r\n“Silly fool!”\r\n\r\nWhether he intended the remark to be heard and thus to close the topic\r\n(which it did), or whether, as deaf people are apt to, merely misjudged\r\nthe audibility of an intended sotto vocalism, I cannot say. I only know\r\nthat outside in the passage I heard the words distinctly, and therefore\r\nassume they reached round the table also.\r\n\r\nA lull in the conversation followed, but Hasluck was not thin-skinned,\r\nand the next thing I distinguished was his cheery laugh.\r\n\r\n“He's quite right,” was Hasluck's comment; “that's what I am\r\nundoubtedly. Because I can't talk about anything but shop myself, I\r\nthink everybody else is the same sort of fool.”\r\n\r\nBut he was doing himself an injustice, for on my next arrival in the\r\npassage he was again shouting across the table, and this time Teidelmann\r\nwas evidently interested.\r\n\r\n“Well, if you could spare the time, I'd be more obliged than I can tell\r\nyou,” Hasluck was saying. “I know absolutely nothing about pictures\r\nmyself, and Pearsall says you are one of the best judges in Europe.”\r\n\r\n“He ought to know,” chuckled old Teidelmann. “He's tried often enough to\r\npalm off rubbish onto me.”\r\n\r\n“That last purchase of yours must have been a good thing for young--”\r\n Hasluck mentioned the name of a painter since world famous; “been the\r\nmaking of him, I should say.”\r\n\r\n“I gave him two thousand for the six,” replied Teidelmann, “and they'll\r\nsell for twenty thousand.”\r\n\r\n“But you'll never sell them?” exclaimed my father.\r\n\r\n“No,” grunted old Teidelmann, “but my widow will.” There came a soft,\r\nlow laugh from a corner of the table I could not see.\r\n\r\n“It's Anderson's great disappointment,” followed a languid, caressing\r\nvoice (the musical laugh translated into prose, it seemed), “that he has\r\nnever been able to educate me to a proper appreciation of art. He'll pay\r\nthousands of pounds for a child in rags or a badly dressed Madonna. Such\r\na waste of money, it appears to me.”\r\n\r\n“But you would pay thousands for a diamond to hang upon your neck,”\r\n argued my father's voice.\r\n\r\n“It would enhance the beauty of my neck,” replied the musical voice.\r\n\r\n“An even more absolute waste of money,” was my father's answer, spoken\r\nlow. And I heard again the musical, soft laugh.\r\n\r\n“Who is she?” I asked Barbara.\r\n\r\n“The second Mrs. Teidelmann,” whispered Barbara. “She is quite a swell.\r\nMarried him for his money--I don't like her myself, but she's very\r\nbeautiful.”\r\n\r\n“As beautiful as you?” I asked incredulously. We were sitting on the\r\nstairs, sharing a jelly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, me!” answered Barbara. “I'm only a child. Nobody takes any notice\r\nof me--except other kids, like you.” For some reason she appeared out of\r\nconceit with herself, which was not her usual state of mind.\r\n\r\n“But everybody thinks you beautiful,” I maintained.\r\n\r\n“Who?” she asked quickly.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Hal,” I answered.\r\n\r\nWe were with our backs to the light, so that I could not see her face.\r\n\r\n“What did he say?” she asked, and her voice had more of contentment in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI could not remember his exact words, but about the sense of them I was\r\npositive.\r\n\r\n“Ask him what he thinks of me, as if you wanted to know yourself,”\r\n Barbara instructed me, “and don't forget what he says this time. I'm\r\ncurious.” And though it seemed to me a foolish command--for what could\r\nhe say of her more than I myself could tell her--I never questioned\r\nBarbara's wishes.\r\n\r\nYet if I am right in thinking that jealousy of Mrs. Teidelmann may have\r\nclouded for a moment Barbara's sunny nature, surely there was no reason\r\nfor this, seeing that no one attracted greater attention throughout the\r\ndinner than the parlour-maid.\r\n\r\n“Where ever did you get her from?” asked Mrs. Florret, Barbara having\r\njust descended the kitchen stairs.\r\n\r\n“A neat-handed Phillis,” commented Dr. Florret with approval.\r\n\r\n“I'll take good care she never waits at my table,” laughed the wife\r\nof our minister, the Rev. Cottle, a broad-built, breezy-voiced woman,\r\nmother of eleven, eight of them boys.\r\n\r\n“To tell the truth,” said my mother, “she's only here temporarily.”\r\n\r\n“As a matter of fact,” said my father, “we have to thank Mrs. Hasluck\r\nfor her.”\r\n\r\n“Don't leave me out of it,” laughed Hasluck; “can't let the old girl\r\ntake all the credit.”\r\n\r\nLater my father absent-mindedly addressed her as “My dear,” at which\r\nMrs. Cottle shot a swift glance towards my mother; and before that\r\nincident could have been forgotten, Hasluck, when no one was\r\nlooking, pinched her elbow, which would not have mattered had not the\r\nunexpectedness of it drawn from her an involuntary “augh,” upon which,\r\nfor the reputation of the house, and the dinner being then towards\r\nits end; my mother deemed it better to take the whole company into\r\nher confidence. Naturally the story gained for Barbara still greater\r\nadmiration, so that when with the dessert, discarding the apron but\r\nstill wearing the dainty cap, which showed wisdom, she and the footman\r\ntook their places among the guests, she was even more than before the\r\ncentre of attention and remark.\r\n\r\n“It was very nice of you,” said Mrs. Cottle, thus completing the circle\r\nof compliments, “and, as I always tell my girls, that is better than\r\nbeing beautiful.”\r\n\r\n“Kind hearts,” added Dr. Florret, summing up the case, “are more than\r\ncoronets.” Dr. Florret had ever ready for the occasion the correct\r\nquotation, but from him, somehow, it never irritated; rather it fell\r\nupon the ear as a necessary rounding and completing of the theme; like\r\nthe Amen in church.\r\n\r\nOnly to my aunt would further observations have occurred.\r\n\r\n“When I was a girl,” said my aunt, breaking suddenly upon the passing\r\nsilence, “I used to look into the glass and say to myself: 'Fanny,\r\nyou've got to be amiable,' and I was amiable,” added my aunt,\r\nchallenging contradiction with a look; “nobody can say that I wasn't,\r\nfor years.”\r\n\r\n“It didn't pay?” suggested Hasluck.\r\n\r\n“It attracted,” replied my aunt, “no attention whatever.”\r\n\r\nHasluck had changed places with my mother, and having after many\r\nexperiments learned the correct pitch for conversation with old\r\nTeidelmann, talked with him as much aside as the circumstances of the\r\ncase would permit. Hasluck never wasted time on anything else than\r\nbusiness. It was in his opera box on the first night of Verdi's Aida (I\r\nam speaking of course of days then to come) that he arranged", ",” replied my aunt, “no attention whatever.”\r\n\r\nHasluck had changed places with my mother, and having after many\r\nexperiments learned the correct pitch for conversation with old\r\nTeidelmann, talked with him as much aside as the circumstances of the\r\ncase would permit. Hasluck never wasted time on anything else than\r\nbusiness. It was in his opera box on the first night of Verdi's Aida (I\r\nam speaking of course of days then to come) that he arranged the details\r\nof his celebrated deal in guano; and even his very religion, so I have\r\nbeen told and can believe, he varied to suit the enterprise of the\r\nmoment, once during the protracted preliminaries of a cocoa scheme\r\nbecoming converted to Quakerism.\r\n\r\nBut for the most of us interest lay in a discussion between Washburn and\r\nFlorret concerning the superior advantages attaching to residence in the\r\nEast End.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, incorrect opinion found itself unable to exist in Dr.\r\nFlorret's presence. As no bird, it is said, can continue its song once\r\nlooked at by an owl, so all originality grew silent under the cold stare\r\nof his disapproving eye. But Dr. “Fighting Hal” was no gentle warbler\r\nof thought. Vehement, direct, indifferent, he swept through all polite\r\nargument as a strong wind through a murmuring wood, carrying his\r\npartisans with him further than they meant to go, and quite unable to\r\nturn back; leaving his opponents clinging desperately--upside down,\r\nanyhow--to their perches, angry, their feathers much ruffled.\r\n\r\n“Life!” flung out Washburn--Dr. Florret had just laid down unimpeachable\r\nrules for the conduct of all mankind on all occasions--“what do you\r\nrespectable folk know of life? You are not men and women, you are\r\nmarionettes. You don't move to your natural emotions implanted by God;\r\nyou dance according to the latest book of etiquette. You live and love,\r\nlaugh and weep and sin by rule. Only one moment do you come face to face\r\nwith life; that is in the moment when you die, leaving the other puppets\r\nto be dressed in black and make believe to cry.”\r\n\r\nIt was a favourite subject of denunciation with him, the artificiality\r\nof us all.\r\n\r\n“Little doll,” he had once called me, and I had resented the term.\r\n\r\n“That's all you are, little Paul,” he had persisted, “a good little\r\nhard-working doll, that does what it's made to do, and thinks what\r\nit's made to think. We are all dolls. Your father is a gallant-hearted,\r\nsoft-headed little doll; your mother the sweetest and primmest of dolls.\r\nAnd I'm a silly, dissatisfied doll that longs to be a man, but hasn't\r\nthe pluck. We are only dolls, little Paul.”\r\n\r\n“He's a trifle--a trifle whimsical on some subjects,” explained my\r\nfather, on my repeating this conversation.\r\n\r\n“There are a certain class of men,” explained my mother--“you will meet\r\nwith them more as you grow up--who talk for talking's sake. They don't\r\nknow what they mean. And nobody else does either.”\r\n\r\n“But what would you have?” argued Dr. Florret, “that every man should do\r\nthat which is right in his own eyes?”\r\n\r\n“Far better than, like the old man in the fable, he should do what every\r\nother fool thinks right,” retorted Washburn. “The other day I called\r\nto see whether a patient of mine was still alive or not. His wife was\r\nwashing clothes in the front room. 'How's your husband?' I asked. 'I\r\nthink he's dead,' replied the woman. Then, without leaving off her work,\r\n'Jim,' she shouted, 'are you there?' No answer came from the inner room.\r\n'He's a goner,' she said, wringing out a stocking.”\r\n\r\n“But surely,” said Dr. Florret, “you don't admire a woman for being\r\nindifferent to the death of her husband?”\r\n\r\n“I don't admire her for that,” replied Washburn, “and I don't blame her.\r\nI didn't make the world and I'm not responsible for it. What I do admire\r\nher for is not pretending a grief she didn't feel. In Berkeley Square\r\nshe'd have met me at the door with an agonised face and a handkerchief\r\nto her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Assume a virtue, if you have it not,” murmured Dr. Florret.\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said Washburn. “How does it run? 'That monster, custom, who all\r\nsense doth eat, of devil's habit, is angel yet in this, that to the use\r\nof actions fair and good he gives a frock that aptly is put on.' So was\r\nthe lion's skin by the ass, but it showed him only the more an ass. Here\r\nasses go about as asses, but there are lions also. I had a woman under\r\nmy hands only a little while ago. I could have cured her easily. Why she\r\ngot worse every day instead of better I could not understand. Then by\r\naccident learned the truth: instead of helping me she was doing all\r\nshe could to kill herself. 'I must, Doctor,' she cried. 'I must. I have\r\npromised. If I get well he will only leave me, and if I die now he has\r\nsworn to be good to the children.' Here, I tell you, they live--think\r\ntheir thoughts, work their will, kill those they hate, die for those\r\nthey love; savages if you like, but savage men and women, not bloodless\r\ndolls.”\r\n\r\n“I prefer the dolls,” concluded Dr. Florret.\r\n\r\n“I admit they are pretty,” answered Washburn.\r\n\r\n“I remember,” said my father, “the first masked ball I ever went to when\r\nI was a student in Paris. It struck me just as you say, Hal; everybody\r\nwas so exactly alike. I was glad to get out into the street and see\r\nfaces.”\r\n\r\n“But I thought they always unmasked at midnight,” said the second Mrs.\r\nTeidelmann in her soft, languid tones.\r\n\r\n“I did not wait,” explained my father.\r\n\r\n“That was a pity,” she replied. “I should have been interested to see\r\nwhat they were like, underneath.”\r\n\r\n“I might have been disappointed,” answered my father. “I agree with Dr.\r\nFlorret that sometimes the mask is an improvement.”\r\n\r\nBarbara was right. She was a beautiful woman, with a face that would\r\nhave been singularly winning if one could have avoided the hard cold\r\neyes ever restless behind the half-closed lids.\r\n\r\nAlways she was very kind to me. Moreover, since the disappearance of\r\nCissy she was the first to bestow again upon me a good opinion of my\r\nsmall self. My mother praised me when I was good, which to her was the\r\none thing needful; but few of us, I fear, child or grown-up, take much\r\npride in our solid virtues, finding them generally hindrances to our\r\ndesires: like the oyster's pearl, of more comfort to the world than to\r\nourselves. If others there were who admired me, very guardedly must they\r\nhave kept the secret I would so gladly have shared with them. But this\r\nnew friend of ours--or had I not better at once say enemy--made me feel\r\nwhen in her presence a person of importance. How it was accomplished\r\nI cannot explain. No word of flattery nor even of mere approval ever\r\npassed her lips. Her charm to me was not that she admired me, but that\r\nshe led me by some mysterious process to admire myself.\r\n\r\nAnd yet in spite of this and many lesser kindnesses she showed to me,\r\nI never really liked her; but rather feared her, dreading always the\r\nsudden raising of those ever half-closed eyelids.\r\n\r\nShe sat next to my father at the corner of the table, her chin resting\r\non her long white hands, her sweet lips parted, and as often as his\r\neyes were turned away from her, her soft low voice would draw them back\r\nagain. Once she laid her hand on his, laughing the while at some light\r\njest of his, and I saw that he flushed; and following his quick glance,\r\nsaw that my mother's eyes were watching also.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of my father only as he then appeared to", " the corner of the table, her chin resting\r\non her long white hands, her sweet lips parted, and as often as his\r\neyes were turned away from her, her soft low voice would draw them back\r\nagain. Once she laid her hand on his, laughing the while at some light\r\njest of his, and I saw that he flushed; and following his quick glance,\r\nsaw that my mother's eyes were watching also.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of my father only as he then appeared to me, a child--an\r\nolder chum with many lines about his mobile mouth, the tumbled hair\r\nedged round with grey; but looking back with older eyes, I see him a\r\nslightly stooping, yet still tall and graceful man, with the face of a\r\npoet--the face I mean a poet ought to possess but rarely does, nature\r\napparently abhorring the obvious--with the shy eyes of a boy, and a\r\nvoice tender as a woman's. Never the dingiest little drab that entered\r\nthe kitchen but adored him, speaking always of “the master” in tones of\r\nfond proprietorship, for to the most slatternly his “orders” had ever\r\nthe air of requests for favours. Women, I so often read, can care for\r\nonly masterful men. But may there not be variety in women as in other\r\nspecies? Or perhaps--if the suggestion be not over-daring--the many\r\nwriters, deeming themselves authorities upon this subject of woman, may\r\nin this one particular have erred? I only know my father spoke to\r\nfew women whose eyes did not brighten. Yet hardly should I call him a\r\nmasterful man.\r\n\r\n“I think it's all right,” whispered Hasluck to my father in the\r\npassage--they were the last to go. “What does she think of it, eh?”\r\n\r\n“I think she'll be with us,” answered my father.\r\n\r\n“Nothing like food for bringing people together,” said Hasluck.\r\n“Good-night.”\r\n\r\nThe door closed, but Something had crept into the house. It stood\r\nbetween my father and mother. It followed them silently up the narrow\r\ncreaking stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nOF THE PASSING OF THE SHADOW.\r\n\r\nBetter is little, than treasure and trouble therewith. Better a dinner\r\nof herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith. None\r\nbut a great man would have dared to utter such a glaring commonplace as\r\nthat. Not only on Sundays now, but all the week, came the hot joint to\r\ntable, and on every day there was pudding, till a body grew indifferent\r\nto pudding; thus a joy-giving luxury of life being lost and but another\r\nitem added to the long list of uninteresting needs. Now we could eat and\r\ndrink without stint. No need now to organise for the morrow's hash.\r\nNo need now to cut one's bread instead of breaking it, thinking of\r\nSaturday's bread pudding. But there the saying fails, for never now were\r\nwe merry. A silent unseen guest sat with us at the board, so that no\r\nlonger we laughed and teased as over the half pound of sausages or the\r\ntwo sweet-scented herrings; but talked constrainedly of empty things\r\nthat lay outside us.\r\n\r\nEasy enough would it have been for us to move to Guilford Street.\r\nOccasionally in the spiritless tones in which they now spoke on all\r\nsubjects save the one, my mother and father would discuss the project;\r\nbut always into the conversation would fall, sooner or later, some\r\nloosened thought to stir it to anger, and so the aching months went by,\r\nand the cloud grew.\r\n\r\nThen one day the news came that old Teidelmann had died suddenly in his\r\ncounting house.\r\n\r\n“You are going to her?” said my mother.\r\n\r\n“I have been sent for,” said my father; “I must--it may mean business.”\r\n\r\nMy mother laughed bitterly; why, at the time, I could not understand;\r\nand my father flung out of the house. During the many hours that he was\r\naway my mother remained locked in her room, and, stealing sometimes to\r\nthe door, I was sure I heard her crying; and that she should grieve so\r\nat old Teidelmann's death puzzled me.\r\n\r\nShe came oftener to our house after that. Her mourning added, I think,\r\nto her beauty, softening--or seeming to soften--the hardness of her\r\neyes. Always she was very sweet to my mother, who by contrast beside her\r\nappeared witless and ungracious; and to me, whatever her motive, she was\r\nkindness itself; hardly ever arriving without some trifling gift or plan\r\nfor affording me some childish treat. By instinct she understood exactly\r\nwhat I desired and liked, the books that would appeal to me as those my\r\nmother gave me never did, the pleasures that did please me as opposed to\r\nthe pleasures that should have pleased me. Often my mother, talking\r\nto me, would chill me with the vista of the life that lay before me:\r\na narrow, viewless way between twin endless walls of “Must” and “Must\r\nnot.” This soft-voiced lady set me dreaming of life as of sunny fields\r\nthrough which one wandered laughing, along the winding path of Will; so\r\nthat, although as I have said, there lurked at the bottom of my thoughts\r\na fear of her; yet something within me I seemed unable to control went\r\nout to her, drawn by her subtle sympathy and understanding of it.\r\n\r\n“Has he ever seen a pantomime?” she asked of my father one morning,\r\nlooking at me the while with a whimsical screwing of her mouth.\r\n\r\nMy heart leaped within me. My father raised his eyebrows: “What would\r\nyour mother say, do you think?” he asked. My heart sank.\r\n\r\n“She thinks,” I replied, “that theatres are very wicked places.” It\r\nwas the first time that any doubt as to the correctness of my mother's\r\njudgments had ever crossed my mind.\r\n\r\nMrs. Teidelmann's smile strengthened my doubt. “Dear me,” she said, “I\r\nam afraid I must be very wicked. I have always regarded a pantomime as\r\nquite a moral entertainment. All the bad people go down so very straight\r\nto--well, to the fit and proper place for them. And we could promise to\r\nleave before the Clown stole the sausages, couldn't we, Paul?”\r\n\r\nMy mother was called and came; and I could not help thinking how\r\ninsignificant she looked with her pale face and plain dark frock,\r\nstanding stiffly beside this shining lady in her rustling clothes.\r\n\r\n“You will let him come, Mrs. Kelver,” she pleaded in her soft caressing\r\ntones; “it's Dick Whittington, you know--such an excellent moral.”\r\n\r\nMy mother had stood silent, clasping and unclasping her hands, a\r\nchildish trick she had when troubled; and her lips were trembling.\r\nImportant as the matter loomed before my own eyes, I wondered at her\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n“I am very sorry,” said my mother, “it is very kind of you. But I would\r\nrather he did not go.”\r\n\r\n“Just this once,” persisted Mrs. Teidelmann. “It is holiday time.”\r\n\r\nA ray of sunlight fell into the room, lighting upon her coaxing face,\r\nmaking where my mother stood seem shadow.\r\n\r\n“I would rather he did not go,” repeated my mother, and her voice\r\nsounded harsh and grating. “When he is older others must judge for him,\r\nbut for the present he must be guided by me--alone.”\r\n\r\n“I really don't think there could be any harm, Maggie,” urged my father.\r\n“Things have changed since we were young.”\r\n\r\n“That may be,” answered my mother, still in the same harsh voice; “it is\r\nlong ago since then.”\r\n\r\n“I didn't intend it that way,” said my father with a short laugh.\r\n\r\n“I merely meant that I may be wrong,” answered my mother. “I seem so old\r\namong you all--so out of place. I have tried to change, but I cannot.”\r\n\r\n“We will say no more about it,” said Mrs. Teidelmann, sweetly. “I merely\r\nthought it would give him pleasure; and he has worked so hard this last\r\nterm, his father tells me.”\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand caressingly on my shoulder, drawing me a little closer\r\nto her; and it remained there.\r\n\r\n“It was very kind of you,” said my mother, “I would", " out of place. I have tried to change, but I cannot.”\r\n\r\n“We will say no more about it,” said Mrs. Teidelmann, sweetly. “I merely\r\nthought it would give him pleasure; and he has worked so hard this last\r\nterm, his father tells me.”\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand caressingly on my shoulder, drawing me a little closer\r\nto her; and it remained there.\r\n\r\n“It was very kind of you,” said my mother, “I would do anything to give\r\nhim pleasure, anything--I could. He knows that. He understands.”\r\n\r\nMy mother's hand, I knew, was seeking mine, but I was angry and would\r\nnot see; and without another word she left the room.\r\n\r\nMy mother did not allude again to the subject; but the very next\r\nafternoon she took me herself to a hall in the neighbourhood, where we\r\nsaw a magic-lantern, followed by a conjurer. She had dressed herself in\r\na prettier frock than she had worn for many a long day, and was brighter\r\nand gayer in herself than had lately been her wont, laughing and talking\r\nmerrily. But I, nursing my wrongs, remained moody and sulky. At any\r\nother time such rare amusement would have overjoyed me; but the wonders\r\nof the great theatre that from other boys I had heard so much of, that\r\nfrom gaudy-coloured posters I had built up for myself, were floating\r\nvague and undefined before me in the air; and neither the open-mouthed\r\nsleeper, swallowing his endless chain of rats; nor even the live rabbit\r\nfound in the stout old gentleman's hat--the last sort of person in whose\r\nhat one would have expected to find such a thing--could draw away my\r\nmind from the joy I had caught a glimpse of only to lose.\r\n\r\nSo we walked home through the muddy, darkening streets, speaking but\r\nlittle; and that night, waking--or rather half waking, as children do--I\r\nthought I saw a figure in white crouching at the foot of my bed. I must\r\nhave gone to sleep again; and later, though I cannot say whether the\r\nintervening time was short or long, I opened my eyes to see it still\r\nthere; and frightened, I cried out; and my mother rose from her knees.\r\n\r\nShe laughed, a curious broken laugh, in answer to my questions. “It was\r\na silly dream I had,” she explained “I must have been thinking of the\r\nconjurer we saw. I dreamt that a wicked Magician had spirited you away\r\nfrom me. I could not find you and was all alone in the world.”\r\n\r\nShe put her arms around me, so tight as almost to hurt me. And thus we\r\nremained until again I must have fallen asleep.\r\n\r\nIt was towards the close of these same holidays that my mother and I\r\ncalled upon Mrs. Teidelmann in her great stone-built house at Clapton.\r\nShe had sent a note round that morning, saying she was suffering from\r\nterrible headaches that quite took her senses away, so that she was\r\nunable to come out. She would be leaving England in a few days to\r\ntravel. Would my mother come and see her, she would like to say good-bye\r\nto her before she went. My mother handed the letter across the table to\r\nmy father.\r\n\r\n“Of course you will go,” said my father. “Poor girl, I wonder what the\r\ncause can be. She used to be so free from everything of the kind.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think it well for me to go?” said my mother. “What can she have\r\nto say to me?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, just to say good-bye,” answered my father. “It would look so\r\npointed not to go.”\r\n\r\nIt was a dull, sombre house without, but one entered through its\r\ncommonplace door as through the weed-grown rock into Aladdin's cave. Old\r\nTeidelmann had been a great collector all his life, and his treasures,\r\nnow scattered through a dozen galleries, were then heaped there in\r\ncurious confusion. Pictures filled every inch of wall, stood propped\r\nagainst the wonderful old furniture, were even stretched unframed across\r\nthe ceilings. Statues gleamed from every corner (a few of the statues\r\nwere, I remember, the only things out of the entire collection that Mrs.\r\nTeidelmann kept for herself), carvings, embroideries, priceless china,\r\nminiatures framed in gems, illuminated missals and gorgeously bound\r\nbooks crowded the room. The ugly little thick-lipped man had surrounded\r\nhimself with the beauty of every age, brought from every land. He\r\nhimself must have been the only thing cheap and uninteresting to be\r\nfound within his own walls; and now he lay shrivelled up in his coffin,\r\nunder a monument by means of which an unknown cemetery became quite\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\nInstructions had been given that my mother was to be shown up into Mrs.\r\nTeidelmann's boudoir. She was lying on a sofa near the fire when we\r\nentered, asleep, dressed in a loose lace robe that fell away, showing\r\nher thin but snow-white arms, her rich dark hair falling loose about\r\nher. In sleep she looked less beautiful: harder and with a suggestion of\r\ncoarseness about the face, of which at other times it showed no trace.\r\nMy mother said she would wait, perhaps Mrs. Teidelmann would awake; and\r\nthe servant, closing the door softly, left us alone with her.\r\n\r\nAn old French clock standing on the mantelpiece, a heart supported by\r\nCupids, ticked with a muffled, soothing sound. My mother, choosing a\r\nchair by the window, sat with her eyes fixed on the sleeping woman's\r\nface, and it seemed to me--though this may have been but my fancy born\r\nof after-thought--that a faint smile relaxed for a moment the sleeping\r\nwoman's pained, pressed lips. Neither I nor my mother spoke, the only\r\nsound in the room being the hushed ticking of the great gilt clock.\r\nUntil the other woman after a few slight movements of unrest began to\r\ntalk in her sleep.\r\n\r\nOnly confused murmurs escaped her at first, and then I heard her whisper\r\nmy father's name. Very low--hardly more than breathed--were the words,\r\nbut upon the silence each syllable struck clear and distinct: “Ah no, we\r\nmust not. Luke, my darling.”\r\n\r\nMy mother rose swiftly from her chair, but she spoke in quite\r\nmatter-of-fact tones.\r\n\r\n“Go, Paul,” she said, “wait for me downstairs;” and noiselessly opening\r\nthe door, she pushed me gently out, and closed it again behind me.\r\n\r\nIt was half an hour or more before she came down, and at once we left\r\nthe house, letting ourselves out. All the way home my mother never once\r\nspoke, but walked as one in a dream with eyes that saw not. With her\r\nhand upon the lock of our gate she came back to life.\r\n\r\n“You must say nothing, Paul, do you understand?” she said. “When people\r\nare delirious they use strange words that have no meaning. Do you\r\nunderstand, Paul; you must never breathe a word--never.”\r\n\r\nI promised, and we entered the house; and from that day my mother's\r\nwhole manner changed. Not another angry word ever again escaped her\r\nlips, never an angry flash lighted up again her eyes. Mrs. Teidelmann\r\nremained away three months. My father, of course, wrote to her often,\r\nfor he was managing all her affairs. But my mother wrote to her\r\nalso--though this my father, I do not think, knew--long letters that she\r\nwould go away by herself to pen, writing them always in the twilight,\r\nclose to the window.\r\n\r\n“Why do you choose this time, just when it's getting dark, to write your\r\nletters,” my father would expostulate, when by chance he happened to\r\nlook into the room. “Let me ring for the lamp, you will strain your\r\neyes.” But my mother would always excuse herself, saying she had only a\r\nfew lines to finish.\r\n\r\n“I can think better in this light,” she would explain.\r\n\r\nAnd when Mrs. Teidelmann returned, it was my mother who was the first\r\nto call upon her; before even my father knew that she was back. And from\r\nthence onward one might have thought them the closest of friends, my\r\nmother", " room. “Let me ring for the lamp, you will strain your\r\neyes.” But my mother would always excuse herself, saying she had only a\r\nfew lines to finish.\r\n\r\n“I can think better in this light,” she would explain.\r\n\r\nAnd when Mrs. Teidelmann returned, it was my mother who was the first\r\nto call upon her; before even my father knew that she was back. And from\r\nthence onward one might have thought them the closest of friends, my\r\nmother visiting her often, speaking of her to all in terms of praise and\r\nliking.\r\n\r\nIn this way peace returned unto the house, and my father was tender\r\nagain in all his words and actions towards my mother, and my mother\r\nthoughtful as before of all his wants and whims, her voice soft and low,\r\nthe sweet smile ever lurking around her lips as in the old days before\r\nthis evil thing had come to dwell among us; and I might have forgotten\r\nit had ever cast its blight upon our life but that every day my mother\r\ngrew feebler, the little ways that had seemed a part of her gone from\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe summer came and went--that time in towns of panting days and\r\nstifling nights, when through the open window crawls to one's face the\r\nhot foul air, heavy with reeking odours drawn from a thousand streets;\r\nwhen lying awake one seems to hear the fitful breathing of the myriad\r\nmass around, as of some over-laboured beast too tired to even rest; and\r\nmy mother moved about the house ever more listlessly.\r\n\r\n“There's nothing really the matter with her,” said Dr. Hal, “only\r\nweakness. It is the place. Cannot you get her away from it?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot leave myself,” said my father, “just yet; but there is no\r\nreason why you and the boy should not take a holiday. This year I can\r\nafford it, and later I might possibly join you.”\r\n\r\nMy mother consented, as she did to all things now, and so it came about\r\nthat again of afternoons we climbed--though more slowly and with many\r\npauses--the steep path to the ruined tower old Jacob in his happy\r\nfoolishness had built upon the headland, rested once again upon its\r\ntopmost platform, sheltered from the wind that ever blew about its\r\ncrumbling walls, saw once more the distant mountains, faint like\r\nspectres, and the silent ships that came and vanished, and about our\r\nfeet the pleasant farm lands, and the grave, sweet river.\r\n\r\nWe had taken lodgings in the village: smaller now it seemed than\r\npreviously; but wonderful its sunny calm, after the turmoil of the\r\nfierce dark streets. Mrs. Fursey was there still, but quite another than\r\nthe Mrs. Fursey of my remembrance, a still angular but cheery dame,\r\nbent no longer on suppressing me, but rather on drawing me out before\r\nadmiring neighbours, as one saying: “The material was unpromising, as\r\nyou know. There were times when I almost despaired. But with\r\npatience, and--may I say, a natural gift that way--you see what can\r\nbe accomplished!” And Anna, now a buxom wife and mother, with an\r\nuncontrollable desire to fall upon and kiss me at most unexpected\r\nmoments, necessitating a never sleeping watchfulness on my part, and\r\na choosing of positions affording means of ready retreat. And old\r\nChumbley, still cobbling shoes in his tiny cave. On the bench before\r\nhim in a row they sat and watched him while he tapped and tapped and\r\nhammered: pert little shoes piping “Be quick, be quick, we want to be\r\ntoddling. You seem to have no idea, my good man, how much toddling there\r\nis to be done.” Dapper boots, sighing: “Oh, please make haste, we are\r\nwaiting to dance and to strut. Jack walks in the lane, Jill waits by\r\nthe gate. Oh, deary, how slowly he taps.” Stout sober boots, saying: “As\r\nsoon as you can, old friend. Remember we've work to do.” Flat-footed old\r\nboots, rusty and limp, mumbling: “We haven't much time, Mr. Chumbley.\r\nJust a patch, that is all, we haven't much further to go.” And old Joe,\r\nstill peddling his pack, with the help of the same old jokes. And Tom\r\nPinfold, still puzzled and scratching his head, the rejected fish still\r\nhanging by its tail from his expostulating hand; one might almost have\r\nimagined it the same fish. Grown-up folks had changed but little. Only\r\nthe foolish children had been playing tricks; parties I had left mere\r\nsucking babes now swaggering in pinafore or knickerbocker; children I\r\nhad known now mincing it as men and women; such affectation annoyed me.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon--it was towards the close of the last week of our stay--my\r\nmother and I had climbed, as was so often our wont, to the upper\r\nplatform of old Jacob's tower. My mother leant upon the parapet, her\r\neyes fixed dreamingly upon the distant mountains, and a smile crept to\r\nher lips.\r\n\r\n“What are you thinking of?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, only of things that happened over there”--she nodded her head\r\ntowards the distant hills as to some old crony with whom she shares\r\nsecrets--“when I was a girl.”\r\n\r\n“You lived there, long ago, didn't you, when you were young?” I asked.\r\nBoys do not always stop to consider whether their questions might or\r\nmight not be better expressed.\r\n\r\n“You're very rude,” said my mother--it was long since a tone of her old\r\nself had rung from her in answer to any touch; “it was a very little\r\nwhile ago.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly she raised her head and listened. Perhaps some twenty seconds\r\nshe remained so with her lips parted, and then from the woods came a\r\nfaint, long-drawn “Coo-ee.” We ran to the side of the tower commanding\r\nthe pathway from the village, and waited until from among the dark pines\r\nmy father emerged into the sunlight.\r\n\r\nSeeing us, he shouted again and waved his stick, and from the light of\r\nhis eyes and his gallant bearing, and the spring of his step across the\r\nheathery turf, we knew instinctively that trouble had come upon him.\r\nHe always rose to meet it with that look and air. It was the old Norse\r\nblood in his veins, I suppose. So, one imagines, must those godless old\r\nPirates have sprung to their feet when the North wind, loosed as a hawk\r\nfrom the leash, struck at the beaked prow.\r\n\r\nWe heard his quick step on the rickety stair, and the next moment he was\r\nbetween us, breathing a little hard, but laughing.\r\n\r\nHe stood for awhile beside my mother without speaking, both of them\r\ngazing at the distant hills among which, as my mother had explained,\r\nthings had happened long ago. And maybe, “over there,” their memories\r\nmet and looked upon each other with kind eyes.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember,” said my father, “we climbed up here--it was the first\r\nwalk we took together after coming here. We discussed our plans for the\r\nfuture, how we would retrieve our fortunes.”\r\n\r\n“And the future,” answered my mother, “has a way of making plans for us\r\ninstead.”\r\n\r\n“It would seem so,” replied my father, with a laugh. “I am an unlucky\r\nbeggar, Maggie. I dropped all your money as well as my own down that\r\nwretched mine.”\r\n\r\n“It was the will--it was Fate, or whatever you call it,” said my mother.\r\n“You could not help that, Luke.”\r\n\r\n“If only that damned pump hadn't jambed,” said my father.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember that Mrs. Tharand?” asked my mother.\r\n\r\n“Yes, what of her?”\r\n\r\n“A worldly woman, I always thought her. She called on me the morning we\r\nwere leaving; I don't think you saw her. 'I've been through more worries\r\nthan you would think, to look at me,' she said to me, laughing. I've\r\nalways remembered her words: 'and of all the troubles that come to us in\r\nthis world, believe me, Mrs. Kelver, money troubles are the easiest to\r\nbear.'”", ", what of her?”\r\n\r\n“A worldly woman, I always thought her. She called on me the morning we\r\nwere leaving; I don't think you saw her. 'I've been through more worries\r\nthan you would think, to look at me,' she said to me, laughing. I've\r\nalways remembered her words: 'and of all the troubles that come to us in\r\nthis world, believe me, Mrs. Kelver, money troubles are the easiest to\r\nbear.'”\r\n\r\n“I wish I could think so,” said my father.\r\n\r\n“She rather irritated me at the time,” continued my mother. “I thought\r\nit one of those commonplaces with which we console ourselves for other\r\npeople's misfortunes. But now I know she spoke the truth.”\r\n\r\nThere was silence between them for awhile. Then said my father in a\r\ncheery tone:\r\n\r\n“I've broken with old Hasluck.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you would be compelled to sooner or later,” answered my\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n“Hasluck,” exclaimed my father, with sudden vehemence, “is little better\r\nthan a thief; I told him so.”\r\n\r\n“What did he say?” asked my mother.\r\n\r\n“Laughed, and said that was better than some people.”\r\n\r\nMy father laughed himself.\r\n\r\nI wish to do the memory of Noel Hasluck no injustice. Ever was he a kind\r\nfriend to me; not only then, but in later years, when, having come to\r\nlearn that kindness is rarer in the world than I had dreamt, I was glad\r\nof it. Added to which, if only for Barbara's sake, I would prefer\r\nto write of him throughout in terms of praise. Yet even were his\r\ngood-tempered, thick-skinned ghost (and unless it were good-tempered\r\nand thick-skinned it would be no true ghost of old Noel Hasluck) to\r\nbe reading over my shoulder the words as I write them down, I think it\r\nwould agree with me--I do not think it would be offended with me (for\r\never in his life he was an admirer and a lover of the Truth, being one\r\nof those good fighters capable of respecting even his foe, his enemy,\r\nagainst whom from ten to four, occasionally a little later, he fought\r\nright valiantly) for saying that of all the men who go down into the\r\nCity each day in a cab or 'bus or train, he was perhaps one of the most\r\nunprincipled: and whether that be saying much or little I leave to those\r\nwith more knowledge to decide.\r\n\r\nTo do others, as it was his conviction, right or wrong, that they would\r\ndo him if ever he gave them half a chance, was his notion of “business;”\r\n and in most of his transactions he was successful. “I play a game,”\r\n he would argue, “where cheating is the rule. Nine out of every ten men\r\nround the table are sharpers like myself, and the tenth man is a fool\r\nwho has no business to be there. We prey upon each other, and the cutest\r\nof us is the winner.”\r\n\r\n“But the innocent people, lured by your fine promises,” I ventured once\r\nto suggest to him, “the widows and the orphans?”\r\n\r\n“My dear lad,” he said, with a laugh, laying his fat hand upon my\r\nshoulder, “I remember one of your widows writing me a pathetic letter\r\nabout some shares she had taken in a Silver Company of mine. Lord knows\r\nwhere the mine is now--somewhere in Spain, I think. It looked as though\r\nall her savings were gone. She had an only son, and it was nearly all\r\nthey possessed in the world, etc., etc.--you know the sort of thing.\r\nWell, I did what I've often been numskull enough to do in similar cases,\r\nwrote and offered to buy her out at par. A week later she answered,\r\nthanking me, but saying it did not matter. There had occurred\r\na momentary rise, and she had sold out at a profit--to her own\r\nbrother-in-law, as I discovered, happening to come across the transfers.\r\nYou can find widows and orphans round the Monte Carlo card tables, if\r\nyou like to look for them; they are no more deserving of consideration\r\nthan the rest of the crowd. Besides, if it comes to that, I'm an orphan\r\nmyself;” and he laughed again, one of his deep, hearty, honest laughs.\r\nNo one ever possessed a laugh more suggestive in its every cadence\r\nof simple, transparent honesty. He used to say himself it was worth\r\nthousands to him.\r\n\r\nBetter from the Moralists' point of view had such a man been an\r\nout-and-out rogue. Then might one have pointed, crying: “Behold:\r\nDishonesty, as you will observe in the person of our awful example, to\r\nbe hated, needs but to be seen.” But the duty of the Chronicler is to\r\nbear witness to what he knows, leaving Truth with the whole case before\r\nher to sum up and direct the verdict. In the City, old Hasluck had a\r\nbad reputation and deserved it; in Stoke-Newington--then a green suburb,\r\ncontaining many fine old houses, standing in great wooded gardens--he\r\nwas loved and respected. In his business, he was a man void of all moral\r\nsense, without bowels of compassion for any living thing; in retirement,\r\na man with a strong sense of duty and a fine regard for the rights and\r\nfeelings of others, never happier than when planning to help or give\r\npleasure. In his office, he would have robbed his own mother. At home,\r\nhe would have spent his last penny to add to her happiness or comfort. I\r\nmake no attempt to explain. I only know that such men do exist, and that\r\nHasluck was one of them. One avoids difficulties by dismissing them as a\r\nproduct of our curiously complex civilisation--a convenient phrase; let\r\nus hope the recording angel may be equally impressed by it.\r\n\r\nCasting about for some reason of excuse to myself for my liking of him,\r\nI hit upon the expedient of regarding him as a modern Robin Hood, whom\r\nwe are taught to admire without shame, a Robin Hood up to date, adapted\r\nto the changed conditions of modern environment; making his living\r\nrelieving the rich; taking pleasure relieving the poor.\r\n\r\n“What will you do?” asked my mother.\r\n\r\n“I shall have to give up the office,” answered my father. “Without him\r\nthere's not enough to keep it going. He was quite good-tempered\r\nabout the matter--offered to divide the work, letting me retain\r\nthe straightforward portion for whatever that might be worth. But I\r\ndeclined. Now I know, I feel I would rather have nothing more to do with\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“I think you were quite right,” agreed my mother.\r\n\r\n“What I blame myself for,” said my father, “is that I didn't see through\r\nhim before. Of course he has been making a mere tool of me from the\r\nbeginning. I ought to have seen through him. Why didn't I?”\r\n\r\nThey discussed the future, or, rather, my father discussed, my mother\r\nlistening in silence, stealing a puzzled look at him from time to time,\r\nas though there were something she could not understand.\r\n\r\nHe would take a situation in the City. One had been offered him. It\r\nmight sound poor, but it would be a steady income on which we must\r\ncontrive to live. The little money he had saved must be kept for\r\ninvestments--nothing speculative--judicious “dealings,” by means of\r\nwhich a cool, clear-headed man could soon accumulate capital. Here the\r\ntraining acquired by working for old Hasluck would serve him well. One\r\nman my father knew--quite a dull, commonplace man--starting a few years\r\nago with only a few hundreds, was now worth tens of thousands. Foresight\r\nwas the necessary qualification. You watched the “tendency” of things.\r\nSo often had my father said to himself: “This is going to be a\r\nbig thing. That other, it is no good,” and in every instance his\r\nprognostications had been verified. He had “felt it;” some men had that\r\ngift. Now was the time to use it for practical purposes.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said my father, breaking off, and casting an approving eye upon\r\nthe surrounding scenery, “would be a pleasant place to end one's days.\r\nThe house you had was very pretty and you liked it.", " to be a\r\nbig thing. That other, it is no good,” and in every instance his\r\nprognostications had been verified. He had “felt it;” some men had that\r\ngift. Now was the time to use it for practical purposes.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said my father, breaking off, and casting an approving eye upon\r\nthe surrounding scenery, “would be a pleasant place to end one's days.\r\nThe house you had was very pretty and you liked it. We might enlarge it,\r\nthe drawing-room might be thrown out--perhaps another wing.” I felt that\r\nour good fortune as from this day was at last established.\r\n\r\nBut my mother had been listening with growing impatience, her puzzled\r\nglances giving place gradually to flashes of anger; and now she turned\r\nher face full upon him, her question written plainly thereon, demanding\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nSome idea of it I had even then, watching her; and since I have come to\r\nread it word for word: “But that woman--that woman that loves you, that\r\nyou love. Ah, I know--why do you play with me? She is rich. With her\r\nyour life will be smooth. And the boy--it will be better far for him.\r\nCannot you three wait a little longer? What more can I do? Cannot you\r\nsee that I am surely dying--dying as quickly as I can--dying as that\r\npoor creature your friend once told us of; knowing it was the only thing\r\nshe could do for those she loved. Be honest with me: I am no longer\r\njealous. All that is past: a man is ever younger than a woman, and a man\r\nchanges. I do not blame you. It is for the best. She and I have talked;\r\nit is far better so. Only be honest with me, or at least silent. Will\r\nyou not honour me enough for even that?”\r\n\r\nMy father did not answer, having that to speak of that put my mother's\r\nquestion out of her mind for all time; so that until the end no word\r\nconcerning that other woman passed again between them. Twenty years\r\nlater, nearly, I myself happened to meet her, and then long physical\r\nsuffering had chased the wantonness away for ever from the pain-worn\r\nmouth; but in that hour of waning voices, as some trouble of the fretful\r\nday when evening falls, so she faded from their life; and if even the\r\nremembrance of her returned at times to either of them, I think it must\r\nhave been in those moments when, for no seeming reason, shyly their\r\nhands sought one another.\r\n\r\nSo the truth of the sad ado--how far my mother's suspicions wronged my\r\nfather; for the eye of jealousy (and what loving woman ever lived that\r\nwas not jealous?) has its optic nerve terminating not in the brain\r\nbut in the heart, which was not constructed for the reception of true\r\nvision--I never knew. Later, long after the curtain of green earth\r\nhad been rolled down upon the players, I spoke once on the matter with\r\nDoctor Hal, who must have seen something of the play and with more\r\nunderstanding eyes than mine, and who thereupon delivered to me a short\r\nlecture on life in general, a performance at which he excelled.\r\n\r\n“Flee from temptation and pray that you may be delivered from evil,”\r\n shouted the Doctor--(his was not the Socratic method)--“but remember\r\nthis: that as sure as the sparks fly upward there will come a time when,\r\nhowever fast you run, you will be overtaken--cornered--no one to deliver\r\nyou but yourself--the gods sitting round interested. It is a grim fight,\r\nfor the Thing, you may be sure, has chosen its right moment. And every\r\nwoman in the world will sympathise with you and be just to you, not even\r\ndespising you should you be overcome; for however they may talk, every\r\nwoman in the world knows that male and female cannot be judged by the\r\nsame standard. To woman, Nature and the Law speak with one voice: 'Sin\r\nnot, lest you be cursed of your sex!' It is no law of man: it is the\r\nlaw of creation. When the woman sins, she sins not only against her\r\nconscience, but against her every instinct. But to the man Nature\r\nwhispers: 'Yield.' It is the Law alone that holds him back. Therefore\r\nevery woman in the world, knowing this, will be just to you--every woman\r\nin the world but one--the woman that loves you. From her, hope for no\r\nsympathy, hope for no justice.”\r\n\r\n“Then you think--” I began.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said the Doctor, “that your father loved your mother\r\ndevotedly; but he was one of those fighters that for the first\r\nhalf-dozen rounds or so cause their backers much anxiety. It is a\r\ndangerous method.”\r\n\r\n“Then you think my mother--”\r\n\r\n“I think your mother was a good woman, Paul; and the good woman will\r\nnever be satisfied with man till the Lord lets her take him to pieces\r\nand put him together herself.”\r\n\r\nMy father had been pacing to and fro the tiny platform. Now he came to a\r\nhalt opposite my mother, placing his hands upon her shoulders.\r\n\r\n“I want you to help me, Maggie--help me to be brave. I have only a year\r\nor two longer to live, and there's a lot to be done in that time.”\r\n\r\nSlowly the anger died out of my mother's face.\r\n\r\n“You remember that fall I had when the cage broke,” my father went on.\r\n“Andrews, as you know, feared from the first it might lead to that. But\r\nI always laughed at him.”\r\n\r\n“How long have you known?” my mother asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, about six months. I felt it at the beginning of the year, but I\r\ndidn't say anything to Washburn till a month later. I thought it might\r\nbe only fancy.”\r\n\r\n“And he is sure?”\r\n\r\nMy father nodded.\r\n\r\n“But why have you never told me?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” replied my father, with a laugh, “I didn't want you to know.\r\nIf I could have done without you, I should not have told you now.”\r\n\r\nAnd at this there came a light into my mother's face that never\r\naltogether left it until the end.\r\n\r\nShe drew him down beside her on the seat. I had come nearer; and my\r\nfather, stretching out his hand, would have had me with them. But my\r\nmother, putting her arms about him, held him close to her, as though in\r\nthat moment she would have had him to herself alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nHOW THE MAN IN GREY MADE READY FOR HIS GOING.\r\n\r\nThe eighteen months that followed--for the end came sooner than we had\r\nexpected--were, I think, the happiest days my father and mother had ever\r\nknown; or if happy be not altogether the right word, let me say the most\r\nbeautiful, and most nearly perfect. To them it was as though God in\r\nHis sweet thoughtfulness had sent death to knock lightly at the door,\r\nsaying: “Not yet. You have still a little longer to be together. In a\r\nlittle while.” In those last days all things false and meaningless they\r\nlaid aside. Nothing was of real importance to them but that they should\r\nlove each other, comforting each other, learning to understand each\r\nother. Again we lived poorly; but there was now no pitiful straining\r\nto keep up appearances, no haunting terror of what the neighbours\r\nmight think. The petty cares and worries concerning matters not worth\r\na moment's thought, the mean desires and fears with which we disfigure\r\nourselves, fell from them. There came to them broader thought, a wider\r\ncharity, a deeper pity. Their love grew greater even than their needs,\r\noverflowing towards all things. Sometimes, recalling these months, it\r\nhas seemed to me that we make a mistake seeking to keep Death, God's\r\ngo-between, ever from our thoughts. Is it not closing the door to a\r\nfriend who would help us would we let him (for who knows life so well),\r\nwhispering to us: “In a little while. Only a little longer that you have\r\nto be together. Is it worth taking so much thought for self? Is it worth\r\nwhile being unkind?”\r\n\r\nFrom them a graciousness emanated pervading all around. Even my aunt Fan\r\ndecided for the second time in her career", " from our thoughts. Is it not closing the door to a\r\nfriend who would help us would we let him (for who knows life so well),\r\nwhispering to us: “In a little while. Only a little longer that you have\r\nto be together. Is it worth taking so much thought for self? Is it worth\r\nwhile being unkind?”\r\n\r\nFrom them a graciousness emanated pervading all around. Even my aunt Fan\r\ndecided for the second time in her career to give amiability a trial.\r\nThis intention she announced publicly to my mother and myself one\r\nafternoon soon after our return from Devonshire.\r\n\r\n“I'm a beast of an old woman,” said my aunt, suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Don't say that, Fan,” urged my mother.\r\n\r\n“What's the good of saying 'Don't say it' when I've just said it,”\r\n snapped back my aunt.\r\n\r\n“It's your manner,” explained my mother; “people sometimes think you\r\ndisagreeable.”\r\n\r\n“They'd be daft if they didn't,” interrupted my aunt. “Of course you\r\ndon't really mean it,” continued my mother.\r\n\r\n“Stuff and nonsense,” snorted my aunt; “does she think I'm a fool? I\r\nlike being disagreeable. I like to see 'em squirming.”\r\n\r\nMy mother laughed.\r\n\r\n“I can be agreeable,” continued my aunt, “if I choose. Nobody more so.”\r\n\r\n“Then why not choose?” suggested my mother. “I tried it once,” said my\r\naunt, “and it fell flat. Nothing could have fallen flatter.”\r\n\r\n“It may not have attracted much attention,” replied my mother, with a\r\nsmile, “but one should not be agreeable merely to attract attention.”\r\n\r\n“It wasn't only that,” returned my aunt, “it was that it gave no\r\nsatisfaction to anybody. It didn't suit me. A disagreeable person is at\r\ntheir best when they are disagreeable.”\r\n\r\n“I can hardly agree with you there,” answered my mother.\r\n\r\n“I could do it again,” communed my aunt to herself. There was a\r\nsuggestion of vindictiveness in her tones. “It's easy enough. Look at\r\nthe sort of fools that are agreeable.”\r\n\r\n“I'm sure you could be if you tried,” urged my mother.\r\n\r\n“Let 'em have it,” continued my aunt, still to herself; “that's the way\r\nto teach 'em sense. Let 'em have it.”\r\n\r\nAnd strange though it may seem, my aunt was right and my mother\r\naltogether wrong. My father was the first to notice the change.\r\n\r\n“Nothing the matter with poor old Fan, is there?” he asked. It was one\r\nevening a day or two after my aunt had carried her threat into effect.\r\n“Nothing happened, has there?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered my mother, “nothing that I know of.”\r\n\r\n“Her manner is so strange,” explained my father, “so--so weird.”\r\n\r\nMy mother smiled. “Don't say anything to her. She's trying to be\r\nagreeable.”\r\n\r\nMy father laughed and then looked wistful. “I almost wish she wouldn't,”\r\n he remarked; “we were used to it, and she was rather amusing.”\r\n\r\nBut my aunt, being a woman of will, kept her way; and about the same\r\ntime that occurred tending to confirm her in her new departure. This\r\nwas the introduction into our small circle of James Wellington Gadley.\r\nProperly speaking, it should have been Wellington James, that being the\r\norder in which he had been christened in the year 1815. But in course\r\nof time, and particularly during his school career, it had been borne in\r\nupon him that Wellington is a burdensome name for a commonplace mortal\r\nto bear, and very wisely he had reversed the arrangement. He was a\r\nslightly pompous but simpleminded little old gentleman, very proud of\r\nhis position as head clerk to Mr. Stillwood, the solicitor to whom my\r\nfather was now assistant. Stillwood, Waterhead and Royal dated back\r\nto the Georges, and was a firm bound up with the history--occasionally\r\nshady--of aristocratic England. True, in these later years its glory\r\nwas dwindling. Old Mr. Stillwood, its sole surviving representative,\r\ndeclined to be troubled with new partners, explaining frankly, in\r\nanswer to all applications, that the business was a dying one, and\r\nthat attempting to work it up again would be but putting new wine\r\ninto worn-out skins. But though its clientele was a yearly diminishing\r\nquantity, much business yet remained to it, and that of a good class,\r\nits name being still a synonym for solid respectability; and my father\r\nhad deemed himself fortunate indeed in securing such an appointment.\r\nJames Gadley had entered the firm as office boy in the days of its\r\npride, and had never awakened to the fact that it was not still the most\r\nimportant legal firm within the half mile radius from Lombard Street.\r\nNothing delighted him more than to discuss over and over again the\r\nmany strange affairs in which Stillwood, Waterhead and Royal had been\r\nconcerned, all of which he had at his tongue's tip. Could he find a\r\nhearer, these he would reargue interminably, but with professional\r\nreticence, personages becoming Mr. Y. and Lady X.; and places, “the\r\ncapital of, let us say, a foreign country,” or “a certain town not\r\na thousand miles from where we are now sitting.” The majority of his\r\nfriends, his methods being somewhat forensic, would seek to discourage\r\nhim, but my aunt was a never wearied listener, especially if the case\r\nwere one involving suspicion of mystery and crime. When, during their\r\nvery first conversation, he exclaimed: “Now why--why, after keeping away\r\nfrom his wife for nearly eighteen years, never even letting her know\r\nwhether he was alive or dead, why this sudden resolve to return to her?\r\nThat is what I want explained to me!” he paused, as was his wont, for\r\nsympathetic comment, my aunt, instead of answering as others, with a\r\nyawn: “Oh, I'm sure I don't know. Felt he wanted to see her, I suppose,”\r\n replied with prompt intelligence:\r\n\r\n“To murder her--by slow poison.”\r\n\r\n“To murder her! But why?”\r\n\r\n“In order to marry the other woman.”\r\n\r\n“What other woman?”\r\n\r\n“The woman he had just met and fallen in love with. Before that it was\r\nimmaterial to him what had become of his wife. This woman had said to\r\nhim: 'Come back to me a free man or never see my face again.'”\r\n\r\n“Dear me! Now that's very curious.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing of the sort. Plain common sense.”\r\n\r\n“I mean, it's curious because, as a matter of fact, his wife did die a\r\nlittle later, and he did marry again.”\r\n\r\n“Told you so,” remarked my aunt.\r\n\r\nIn this way every case in the Stillwood annals was reviewed, and light\r\nthrown upon it by my aunt's insight into the hidden springs of human\r\naction. Fortunate that the actors remained mere Mr. X. and Lady Y., for\r\ninto the most innocent seeming behaviour my aunt read ever dark criminal\r\nintent.\r\n\r\n“I think you are a little too severe,” Mr. Gadley would now and then\r\nplead.\r\n\r\n“We're all of us miserable sinners,” my aunt would cheerfully affirm;\r\n“only we don't all get the same chances.”\r\n\r\nAn elderly maiden lady, a Miss Z., residing in “a western town once\r\nfamous as the resort of fashion, but which we will not name,” my aunt\r\nwas convinced had burnt down a house containing a will, and forged\r\nanother under which her children--should she ever marry and be blessed\r\nwith such--would inherit among them on coming of age a fortune of seven\r\nhundred pounds.\r\n\r\nThe freshness of her views on this, his favourite topic, always\r\nfascinated Mr. Gadley.\r\n\r\n“I have to thank you, ma'am,” he would remark on rising, “for a\r\nmost delightful conversation. I may not be able to agree with your\r\nconclusions, but they afford food for reflection.”\r\n\r\nTo which my aunt would reply, “I hate talking to any one who agrees with\r\nme. It's like taking a walk to see one's own looking-glass. I'd rather\r\ntalk to somebody who didn't, even if he were a fool,” which for her was\r\ngracious.\r\n\r\nHe was a stout little gentleman with", " on rising, “for a\r\nmost delightful conversation. I may not be able to agree with your\r\nconclusions, but they afford food for reflection.”\r\n\r\nTo which my aunt would reply, “I hate talking to any one who agrees with\r\nme. It's like taking a walk to see one's own looking-glass. I'd rather\r\ntalk to somebody who didn't, even if he were a fool,” which for her was\r\ngracious.\r\n\r\nHe was a stout little gentleman with a stomach that protruded about a\r\nfoot in front of him, and of this he appeared to be quite unaware. Nor\r\nwould it have mattered had it not been for his desire when talking to\r\napproach as close to his listener as possible. Gradually in the course\r\nof conversation, his stomach acting as a gentle battering ram, he would\r\nin this way drive you backwards round the room, sometimes, unless\r\nyou were artful, pinning you hopelessly into a corner, when it would\r\nsurprise him that in spite of all his efforts he never succeeded in\r\ngetting any nearer to you. His first evening at our house he was talking\r\nto my aunt from the corner of his chair. As he grew more interested so\r\nhe drew his chair nearer and nearer, till at length, having withdrawn\r\ninch by inch to avoid his encroachments, my aunt was sitting on the\r\nextreme edge of her own. His next move sent her on to the floor. She\r\nsaid nothing, which surprised me; but on the occasion of his next\r\nvisit she was busy darning stockings, an unusual occupation for her.\r\nHe approached nearer and nearer as before; but this time she sat\r\nher ground, and it was he who in course of time sprang back with an\r\nexclamation foreign to the subject under discussion.\r\n\r\nEver afterwards my aunt met him with stockings in her hand, and they\r\ntalked with a space between their chairs.\r\n\r\nNothing further came of it, though his being a widower added to their\r\nintercourse that spice of possibility no woman is ever too old to\r\nrelish; but that he admired her intellectually was evident. Once he\r\neven went so far as to exclaim: “Miss Davies, you should have been a\r\nsolicitor's wife!” to his thinking the crown of feminine ambition. To\r\nwhich my aunt had replied: “Chances are I should have been if one had\r\never asked me.” And warmed by appreciation, my aunt's amiability took\r\nroot and flourished, though assuming, as all growth developed late is\r\napt to, fantastic shape.\r\n\r\nThere came to her the idea, by no means ill-founded, that by flattery\r\none can most readily render oneself agreeable; so conscientiously she\r\nset to work to flatter in season and out. I am sure she meant to give\r\npleasure, but the effect produced was that of thinly veiled sarcasm.\r\n\r\nMy father would relate to us some trifling story, some incident noticed\r\nduring the day that had seemed to him amusing. At once she would break\r\nout into enthusiasm, holding up her hands in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“What a funny man he is! And to think that it comes to him naturally\r\nwithout an effort. What a gift it is!”\r\n\r\nOn my mother appearing in a new bonnet, or an old one retrimmed, an\r\nevent not unfrequent; for in these days my mother took more thought than\r\never formerly for her appearance (you will understand, you women who\r\nhave loved), she would step back in simulated amazement.\r\n\r\n“Don't tell me it's a married woman with a boy getting on for fourteen.\r\nIt's a girl. A saucy, tripping girl. That's what it is.”\r\n\r\nPersons have been known, I believe, whose vanity, not checked in time,\r\nhas grown into a hopeless disease. But I am inclined to think that a\r\ndose of my aunt, about this period, would have cured the most obstinate\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nSo also, and solely for our benefit, she assumed a vivacity and\r\nspriteliness that ill suited her, that having regard to her age and\r\ntendency towards rheumatism must have cost her no small effort. From\r\nthese experiences there remains to me the perhaps immoral opinion that\r\nVirtue, in common with all other things, is at her best when unassuming.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the old Adam--or should one say Eve--would assert itself in\r\nmy aunt, and then, still thoughtful for others, she would descend into\r\nthe kitchen and be disagreeable to Amy, our new servitor, who never\r\nminded it. Amy was a philosopher who reconciled herself to all things\r\nby the reflection that there were only twenty-four hours in a day.\r\nIt sounds a dismal theory, but from it Amy succeeded in extracting\r\nperpetual cheerfulness. My mother would apologise to her for my aunt's\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\n“Lord bless you, mum, it don't matter. If I wasn't listening to her\r\nsomething else worse might be happening. Everything's all the same when\r\nit's over.”\r\n\r\nAmy had come to us merely as a stop gap, explaining to my mother that\r\nshe was about to be married and desired only a temporary engagement to\r\nbridge over the few weeks between then and the ceremony.\r\n\r\n“It's rather unsatisfactory,” had said my mother. “I dislike changes.”\r\n\r\n“I can quite understand it, mum,” had replied Amy; “I dislike 'em\r\nmyself. Only I heard you were in a hurry, and I thought maybe that while\r\nyou were on the lookout for somebody permanent--”\r\n\r\nSo on that understanding she came. A month later my mother asked her\r\nwhen she thought the marriage would actually take place.\r\n\r\n“Don't think I'm wishing you to go,” explained my mother, “indeed I'd\r\nlike you to stop. I only want to know in time to make my arrangements.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, some time in the spring, I expect,” was Amy's answer.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said my mother, “I understood it was coming off almost\r\nimmediately.”\r\n\r\nAmy appeared shocked.\r\n\r\n“I must know a little bit more about him before I go as far as that,”\r\n she said.\r\n\r\n“But I don't understand,” said my mother; “you told me when you came to\r\nme that you were going to be married in a few weeks.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that one!” Her tone suggested that an unfair strain was being put\r\nupon her memory. “I didn't feel I wanted him as much as I thought I did\r\nwhen it came to the point.”\r\n\r\n“You had meantime met the other one?” suggested my mother, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Well, we can't help our feelings, can we, mum?” admitted Amy, frankly,\r\n“and what I always say is”--she spoke as one with experience even\r\nthen--“better change your mind before it's too late afterwards.”\r\n\r\nAmiable, sweet-faced, broad-hearted Amy! most faithful of friends, but\r\noh! most faithless of lovers. Age has not withered nor custom staled her\r\nliking for infinite variety. Butchers, bakers, soldiers, sailors, Jacks\r\nof all trades! Does the sighing procession never pass before you, Amy,\r\npointing ghostly fingers of reproach! Still Amy is engaged. To whom at\r\nthe particular moment I cannot say, but I fancy to an early one who has\r\nlately become a widower. After more exact knowledge I do not care to\r\nenquire; for to confess ignorance on the subject, implying that one has\r\ntreated as a triviality and has forgotten the most important detail of\r\na matter that to her is of vital importance, is to hurt her feelings;\r\nwhile to angle for information is but to entangle oneself. To speak of\r\nHim as “Tom,” when Tom has belonged for weeks to the dead and buried\r\npast, to hastily correct oneself to “Dick” when there hasn't been a Dick\r\nfor years, clearly not to know that he is now Harry, annoys her even\r\nmore. In my mother's time we always referred to him as “Dearest.” It was\r\nthe title with which she herself distinguished them all, and it avoided\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n“Well, and how's Dearest?” my mother would enquire, opening the door to\r\nAmy on the Sunday evening.\r\n\r\n“Oh, very well indeed, mum, thank you, and he sends you his respects,”\r\n or, “Well, not so nicely as I could wish. I'm a little anxious about\r\nhim, poor dear!”\r\n\r\n“When you are married you will be able to take good care of him.”\r\n\r\n“That's really what", " them all, and it avoided\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n“Well, and how's Dearest?” my mother would enquire, opening the door to\r\nAmy on the Sunday evening.\r\n\r\n“Oh, very well indeed, mum, thank you, and he sends you his respects,”\r\n or, “Well, not so nicely as I could wish. I'm a little anxious about\r\nhim, poor dear!”\r\n\r\n“When you are married you will be able to take good care of him.”\r\n\r\n“That's really what he wants--some one to take care of him. It's what\r\nthey all want, the poor dears.”\r\n\r\n“And when is it coming off?”\r\n\r\n“In the spring, mum.” She always chose the spring when possible.\r\n\r\nAmy was nice to all men, and to Amy all men were nice. Could she have\r\nmarried a dozen, she might have settled down, with only occasional\r\nregrets concerning those left without in the cold. But to ask her to\r\nselect only one out of so many “poor dears” was to suggest shameful\r\nwaste of affection.\r\n\r\nWe had meant to keep our grim secret to ourselves; but to hide one's\r\ntroubles long from Amy was like keeping cold hands from the fire. Very\r\nsoon she knew everything that was to be known, drawing it all from my\r\nmother as from some overburdened child. Then she put my mother down into\r\na chair and stood over her.\r\n\r\n“Now you leave the house and everything connected with it to me, mum,”\r\n commanded Amy; “you've got something else to do.”\r\n\r\nAnd from that day we were in the hands of Amy, and had nothing else to\r\ndo but praise the Lord for His goodness.\r\n\r\nBarbara also found out (from Washburn, I expect), though she said\r\nnothing, but came often. Old Hasluck would have come himself, I am\r\nsure, had he thought he would be welcome. As it was, he always sent\r\nkind messages and presents of fruit and flowers by Barbara, and always\r\nwelcomed me most heartily whenever she allowed me to see her home.\r\n\r\nShe brought, as ever, sunshine with her, making all trouble seem far off\r\nand shadowy. My mother tended to the fire of love, but Barbara lit the\r\ncheerful lamp of laughter.\r\n\r\nAnd with the lessening days my father seemed to grow younger, life lying\r\nlighter on him.\r\n\r\nOne summer's night he and I were walking with Barbara to Poplar station,\r\nfor sometimes, when he was not looking tired, she would order him to\r\nfetch his hat and stick, explaining to him with a caress, “I like them\r\ntall and slight and full grown. The young ones, they don't know how to\r\nflirt! We will take the boy with us as gooseberry;” and he, pretending\r\nto be anxious that my mother did not see, would kiss her hand, and slip\r\nout quietly with her arm linked under his. It was admirable the way he\r\nwould enter into the spirit of the thing.\r\n\r\nThe last cloud faded from before the moon as we turned the corner, and\r\neven the East India Dock Road lay restful in front of us.\r\n\r\n“I have always regarded myself,” said my father, “as a failure in life,\r\nand it has troubled me.” I felt him pulled the slightest little bit\r\naway from me, as though Barbara, who held his other arm, had drawn him\r\ntowards her with a swift pressure. “But do you know the idea that has\r\ncome to me within the last few months? That on the whole I have been\r\nsuccessful. I am like a man,” continued my father, “who in some deep\r\nwood has been frightened, thinking he has lost his way, and suddenly\r\ncoming to the end of it, finds that by some lucky chance he has been\r\nguided to the right point after all. I cannot tell you what a comfort it\r\nis to me.\r\n\r\n“What is the right point?” asked Barbara.\r\n\r\n“Ah, that I cannot tell you,” answered my father, with a laugh. “I only\r\nknow that for me it is here where I am. All the time I thought I was\r\nwandering away from it I was drawing nearer to it. It is very wonderful.\r\nI am just where I ought to be. If I had only known I never need have\r\nworried.”\r\n\r\nWhether it would have troubled either him or my mother very much even\r\nhad it been otherwise I cannot say, for Life, so small a thing when\r\nlooked at beside Death, seemed to have lost all terror for them; but be\r\nthat as it may, I like to remember that Fortune at the last was kind\r\nto my father, prospering his adventures, not to the extent his sanguine\r\nnature had dreamt, but sufficiently: so that no fear for our future\r\nmarred the peaceful passing of his tender spirit.\r\n\r\nOr should I award thanks not to Fate, but rather to sweet Barbara,\r\nand behind her do I not detect shameless old Hasluck, grinning\r\ngood-naturedly in the background?\r\n\r\n“Now, Uncle Luke, I want your advice. Dad's given me this cheque as a\r\nbirthday present. I don't want to spend it. How shall I invest it?”\r\n\r\n“My dear, why not consult your father?”\r\n\r\n“Now, Uncle Luke, dad's a dear, especially after dinner, but you and\r\nI know him. Giving me a present is one thing, doing business for me\r\nis another. He'd unload on me. He'd never be able to resist the\r\ntemptation.”\r\n\r\nMy father would suggest, and Barbara would thank him. But a minute later\r\nwould murmur: “You don't know anything about Argentinos.”\r\n\r\nMy father did not, but Barbara did; to quite a remarkable extent for a\r\nyoung girl.\r\n\r\n“That child has insisted on leaving this cheque with me and I have\r\nadvised her to buy Argentinos,” my father would observe after she was\r\ngone. “I am going to put a few hundreds into them myself. I hope they\r\nwill turn out all right, if only for her sake. I have a presentiment\r\nsomehow that they will.”\r\n\r\nA month later Barbara would greet him with: “Isn't it lucky we bought\r\nArgentinos!”\r\n\r\n“Yes; they haven't turned out badly, have they? I had a feeling, you\r\nknow, for Argentinos.”\r\n\r\n“You're a genius, Uncle Luke. And now we will sell out and buy\r\nCalcuttas, won't we?”\r\n\r\n“Sell out? But why?”\r\n\r\n“You said so. You said, 'We will sell out in about a month and be quite\r\nsafe.'”\r\n\r\n“My dear, I've no recollection of it.”\r\n\r\nBut Barbara had, and before she had done with him, so had he. And the\r\nnext day Argentinos would be sold--not any too soon--and Calcuttas\r\nbought.\r\n\r\nCould money so gained bring a blessing with it? The question would\r\nplague my father.\r\n\r\n“It's very much like gambling,” he would mutter uneasily to himself at\r\neach success, “uncommonly like gambling.”\r\n\r\n“It is for your mother,” he would impress upon me. “When she is gone,\r\nPaul, put it aside, Keep it for doing good; that may make it clean.\r\nStart your own life without any help from it.”\r\n\r\nHe need not have troubled. It went the road that all luck derived\r\nhowever indirectly from old Hasluck ever went. Yet it served good\r\npurpose on its way.\r\n\r\nBut the most marvellous feat, to my thinking, ever accomplished by\r\nBarbara was the bearing off of my father and mother to witness “A Voice\r\nfrom the Grave, or the Power of Love, New and Original Drama in five\r\nacts and thirteen tableaux.”\r\n\r\nThey had been bred in a narrow creed, both my father and my mother. That\r\nPuritan blood flowed in their veins that throughout our land has drowned\r\nmuch harmless joyousness; yet those who know of it only from hearsay\r\ndo foolishly to speak but ill of it. If ever earnest times should\r\ncome again, not how to enjoy but how to live being the question, Fate\r\ndemanding of us to show not what we have but what we are, we may regret\r\nthat they are fewer among us than formerly, those who trained themselves\r\nto despise all pleasure, because in pleasure they saw the subtlest foe\r\nto principle and duty. No graceful growth, this Puritanism, for its\r\nroots are in the hard, stern facts of life; but it is strong, and from\r\nit", " not how to enjoy but how to live being the question, Fate\r\ndemanding of us to show not what we have but what we are, we may regret\r\nthat they are fewer among us than formerly, those who trained themselves\r\nto despise all pleasure, because in pleasure they saw the subtlest foe\r\nto principle and duty. No graceful growth, this Puritanism, for its\r\nroots are in the hard, stern facts of life; but it is strong, and from\r\nit has sprung all that is worth preserving in the Anglo-Saxon character.\r\nIts men feared and its women loved God, and if their words were harsh\r\ntheir hearts were tender. If they shut out the sunshine from their lives\r\nit was that their eyes might see better the glory lying beyond; and if\r\ntheir view be correct, that earth's threescore years and ten are but\r\nas preparation for eternity, then who shall call them even foolish for\r\nturning away their thoughts from its allurements.\r\n\r\n“Still, I think I should like to have a look at one, just to see what it\r\nis like,” argued my father; “one cannot judge of a thing that one knows\r\nnothing about.”\r\n\r\nI imagine it was his first argument rather than his second that\r\nconvinced my mother.\r\n\r\n“That is true,” she answered. “I remember how shocked my poor father\r\nwas when he found me one night at the bedroom window reading Sir Walter\r\nScott by the light of the moon.”\r\n\r\n“What about the boy?” said my father, for I had been included in the\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\n“We will all be wicked together,” said my mother.\r\n\r\nSo an evening or two later the four of us stood at the corner of Pigott\r\nStreet waiting for the 'bus.\r\n\r\n“It is a close evening,” said my father; “let's go the whole hog and\r\nride outside.”\r\n\r\nIn those days for a lady to ride outside a 'bus was as in these days for\r\na lady to smoke in public. Surely my mother's guardian angel must have\r\nbetaken himself off in a huff.\r\n\r\n“Will you keep close behind and see to my skirt?” answered my mother,\r\ncommencing preparations. If you will remember that these were the days\r\nof crinolines, that the “knife-boards” of omnibuses were then approached\r\nby a perpendicular ladder, the rungs two feet apart, you will understand\r\nthe necessity for such precaution.\r\n\r\nWhich of us was the most excited throughout that long ride it would be\r\ndifficult to say. Barbara, feeling keenly her responsibility as prompter\r\nand leader of the dread enterprise, sat anxious, as she explained to us\r\nafterwards, hoping there would be nothing shocking in the play, nothing\r\nto belie its innocent title; pleased with her success so far, yet\r\nstill fearful of failure, doubtful till the last moment lest we should\r\nsuddenly repent, and stopping the 'bus, flee from the wrath to come.\r\nMy father was the youngest of us all. Compared with him I was sober and\r\ncontained. He fidgeted: people remarked upon it. He hummed. But for\r\nthe stern eye of a thin young man sitting next to him trying to read\r\na paper, I believe he would have broken out into song. Every minute he\r\nwould lean across to enquire of my mother: “How are you feeling--all\r\nright?” To which my mother would reply with a nod and a smile, She sat\r\nvery silent herself, clasping and unclasping her hands. As for myself,\r\nI remember feeling so sorry for the crowds that passed us on their way\r\nhome. It was sad to think of the long dull evening that lay before them.\r\nI wondered how they could face it.\r\n\r\nOur seats were in the front row of the upper circle. The lights were low\r\nand the house only half full when we reached them.\r\n\r\n“It seems very orderly and--and respectable,” whispered my mother. There\r\nseemed a touch of disappointment in her tone.\r\n\r\n“We are rather early,” replied Barbara; “it will be livelier when the\r\nband comes in and they turn up the gas.”\r\n\r\nBut even when this happened my mother was not content. “There is so\r\nlittle room for the actors,” she complained.\r\n\r\nIt was explained to her that the green curtain would go up, that the\r\nstage lay behind.\r\n\r\nSo we waited, my mother sitting stiffly on the extreme edge of her\r\nseat, holding me tightly by the hand; I believe with some vague idea of\r\nflight, should out of that vault-scented gloom the devil suddenly appear\r\nto claim us for his own. But before the curtain was quite up she had\r\nforgotten him.\r\n\r\nYou poor folk that go to the theatre a dozen times a year, perhaps\r\noftener, what do you know of plays? You see no drama, you see but\r\nmiddle-aged Mr. Brown, churchwarden, payer of taxes, foolishly\r\npretending to be a brigand; Miss Jones, daughter of old Jones the\r\nChemist, making believe to be a haughty Princess. How can you, a grown\r\nman, waste money on a seat to witness such tomfoolery! What we saw was\r\nsomething very different. A young and beautiful girl--true, not a lady\r\nby birth, being merely the daughter of an honest yeoman, but one equal\r\nin all the essentials of womanhood to the noblest in the land--suffered\r\nbefore our very eyes an amount of misfortune that, had one not seen it\r\nfor oneself, one would never have believed Fate could have accumulated\r\nupon the head of any single individual. Beside her woes our own poor\r\ntroubles sank into insignificance. We had used to grieve, as my mother\r\nin a whisper reminded my father, if now and again we had not been able\r\nto afford meat for dinner. This poor creature, driven even from her\r\nwretched attic, compelled to wander through the snow without so much as\r\nan umbrella to protect her, had not even a crust to eat; and yet never\r\nlost her faith in Providence. It was a lesson, as my mother remarked\r\nafterwards, that she should never forget. And virtue had been\r\ntriumphant, let shallow cynics say what they will. Had we not proved it\r\nwith our own senses? The villain--I think his Christian name, if one\r\ncan apply the word “Christian” in connection with such a fiend, was\r\nJasper--had never really loved the heroine. He was incapable of love. My\r\nmother had felt this before he had been on the stage five minutes, and\r\nmy father--in spite of protests from callous people behind who appeared\r\nto be utterly indifferent to what was going on under their very\r\nnoses--had agreed with her. What he was in love with was her\r\nfortune--the fortune that had been left to her by her uncle in\r\nAustralia, but about which nobody but the villain knew anything. Had\r\nshe swerved a hair's breadth from the course of almost supernatural\r\nrectitude, had her love for the hero ever weakened, her belief in\r\nhim--in spite of damning evidence to the contrary--for a moment wavered,\r\nthen wickedness might have triumphed. How at times, knowing all the\r\nfacts but helpless to interfere, we trembled, lest deceived by the\r\ncruel lies the villain told her; she should yield to importunity. How\r\nwe thrilled when, in language eloquent though rude, she flung his false\r\nlove back into his teeth. Yet still we feared. We knew well that it was\r\nnot the hero who had done the murder. “Poor dear,” as Amy would have\r\ncalled him, he was quite incapable of doing anything requiring one-half\r\nas much smartness. We knew that it was not he, poor innocent lamb! who\r\nhad betrayed the lady with the French accent; we had heard her on the\r\nsubject and had formed a very shrewd conjecture. But appearances,\r\nwe could not help admitting, were terribly to his disfavour. The\r\ncircumstantial evidence against him would have hanged an Archbishop.\r\nCould she in face of it still retain her faith? There were moments when\r\nmy mother restrained with difficulty her desire to rise and explain.\r\n\r\nBetween the acts Barbara would whisper to her that she was not to mind,\r\nbecause it was only a play, and that everything would be sure to come\r\nright in the end.\r\n\r\n“I know, my dear,” my mother would answer, laughing, “it is very foolish\r\nof me; I forget. Paul, when you see me getting excited, you must remind\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nBut of what use was I", " There were moments when\r\nmy mother restrained with difficulty her desire to rise and explain.\r\n\r\nBetween the acts Barbara would whisper to her that she was not to mind,\r\nbecause it was only a play, and that everything would be sure to come\r\nright in the end.\r\n\r\n“I know, my dear,” my mother would answer, laughing, “it is very foolish\r\nof me; I forget. Paul, when you see me getting excited, you must remind\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nBut of what use was I in such case! I, who only by holding on to the\r\narms of my seat could keep myself from swarming down on to the stage\r\nto fling myself between this noble damsel and her persecutor--this\r\nfair-haired, creamy angel in whose presence for the time being I had\r\nforgotten even Barbara.\r\n\r\nThe end came at last. The uncle from Australia was not dead. The\r\nvillain--bungler as well as knave--had killed the wrong man, somebody of\r\nno importance whatever. As a matter of fact, the comic man himself was\r\nthe uncle from Australia--had been so all along. My mother had had a\r\nsuspicion of this from the very first. She told us so three times, to\r\nmake up, I suppose, for not having mentioned it before. How we cheered\r\nand laughed, in spite of the tears in our eyes.\r\n\r\nBy pure accident it happened to be the first night of the piece, and\r\nthe author, in response to much shouting and whistling, came before the\r\ncurtain. He was fat and looked commonplace; but I deemed him a genius,\r\nand my mother said he had a good face, and waved her handkerchief\r\nwildly; while my father shouted “Bravo!” long after everybody else had\r\nfinished; and people round about muttered “packed house,” which I didn't\r\nunderstand at the time, but came to later.\r\n\r\nAnd stranger still, it happened to be before that very same curtain\r\nthat many years later I myself stepped forth to make my first bow as a\r\nplaywright. I saw the house but dimly, for on such occasion one's vision\r\nis apt to be clouded. All that I saw clearly was in the front row of the\r\nsecond circle--a sweet face laughing though the tears were in her eyes;\r\nand she waved to me a handkerchief. And on one side of her stood a\r\ngallant gentleman with merry eyes who shouted “Bravo!” and on the other\r\na dreamy-looking lad; but he appeared disappointed, having expected\r\nbetter work from me. And the fourth face I could not see, for it was\r\nturned away from me.\r\n\r\nBarbara, determined on completeness, insisted upon supper. In those\r\ndays respectability fed at home; but one resort possible there was, an\r\neating-house with some pretence to gaiety behind St. Clement Danes,\r\nand to that she led us. It was a long, narrow room, divided into wooden\r\ncompartments, after the old coffee-house plan, a gangway down the\r\ncentre. Now we should call it a dismal hole, and closing the door hasten\r\naway. But to Adam, Eve in her Sunday fig-leaves was a stylishly dressed\r\nwoman; and to my eyes, with its gilded mirrors and its flaring gas, the\r\nplace seemed a palace.\r\n\r\nBarbara ordered oysters, a fish that familiarity with its empty shell\r\nhad made me curious concerning. Truly no spot on the globe is so rich in\r\noyster shells as the East End of London. A stranger might be led to the\r\nimpression (erroneous) that the customary lunch of the East End labourer\r\nconsists of oysters. How they collect there in such quantities is a\r\nmystery, though Washburn, to whom I once presented the problem, found no\r\ndifficulty in solving it to his own satisfaction: “To the rich man the\r\noyster; to the poor man the shell; thus are the Creator's gifts divided\r\namong all His creatures; none being sent empty away.” For drink the\r\nothers had stout and I had ginger beer. The waiter, who called me “Sir,”\r\n advised against this mixture; but among us all the dominating sentiment\r\nby this time was that nothing really mattered very much. Afterwards my\r\nfather called for a cigar and boldly lighted it, though my mother looked\r\nanxious; and fortunately perhaps it would not draw. And then it came out\r\nthat he himself had once written a play.\r\n\r\n“You never told me of that,” complained my mother.\r\n\r\n“It was a long while ago,” replied my father; “nothing came of it.”\r\n\r\n“It might have been a success,” said my mother; “you always had a gift\r\nfor writing.”\r\n\r\n“I must look it over again,” said my father; “I had quite forgotten it.\r\nI have an impression it wasn't at all bad.”\r\n\r\n“It can be of much help,” said my mother, “a good play. It makes one\r\nthink.”\r\n\r\nWe put Barbara into a cab and rode home ourselves inside a 'bus. My\r\nmother was tired, so my father slipped his arm round her, telling her\r\nto lean against him, and soon she fell asleep with her head upon his\r\nshoulder. A coarse-looking wench sat opposite, her man's arm round her\r\nlikewise, and she also fell asleep, her powdered face against his coat.\r\n\r\n“They can do with a bit of nursing, can't they?” said the man with a\r\ngrin to the conductor.\r\n\r\n“Ah, they're just kids,” agreed the conductor, sympathetically, “that's\r\nwhat they are, all of 'em, just kids.”\r\n\r\nSo the day ended. But oh, the emptiness of the morrow! Life without\r\na crime, without a single noble sentiment to brighten it!--no comic\r\nuncles, no creamy angels! Oh, the barrenness and dreariness of life!\r\nEven my mother at moments was quite irritable.\r\n\r\nWe were much together again, my father and I, about this time. Often,\r\nmaking my way from school into the City, I would walk home with him, he\r\nleaning on each occasion a little heavier upon my arm. To this day I can\r\nalways meet and walk with him down the Commercial Road. And on Saturday\r\nafternoons, crossing the river to Greenwich, we would climb the hill and\r\nsit there talking, or sometimes merely thinking together, watching the\r\ndim vast city so strangely still and silent at our feet.\r\n\r\nAt first I did not grasp the fact that he was dying. The “year to two”\r\n of life that Washburn had allowed to him had somehow become converted in\r\nmy mind to vague years, a fate with no immediate meaning; the meanwhile\r\nhe himself appeared to grow from day to day in buoyancy. How could I\r\nknow it was his great heart rising to his need.\r\n\r\nThe comprehension came to me suddenly. It was one afternoon in early\r\nspring. I was on my way to the City to meet him. The Holborn Viaduct was\r\nthen in building, and the traffic round about was in consequence always\r\nmuch disorganised. The 'bus on which I was riding became entangled in a\r\nblock at the corner of Snow Hill, and for ten minutes we had been merely\r\ncrawling, one joint of a long, sinuous serpent moving by short, painful\r\njerks. It came to me while I was sitting there with a sharp spasm of\r\nphysical pain. I jumped from the 'bus and began to run, and the terror\r\nand the hurt of it grew with every step. I ran as if I feared he might\r\nbe dead before I could reach the office. He was waiting for me with a\r\nsmile as usual, and I flung myself sobbing into his arms.\r\n\r\nI think he understood, though I could explain nothing, but that I had\r\nhad a fear something had happened to him, for from that time forward\r\nhe dropped all reserve with me, and talked openly of our approaching\r\nparting.\r\n\r\n“It might have come to us earlier, my dear boy,” he would say with his\r\narm round me, “or it might have been a little later. A year or so one\r\nway or the other, what does it matter? And it is only for a little\r\nwhile, Paul. We shall meet again.”\r\n\r\nBut I could not answer him, for clutch them to me as I would, all my\r\nbeliefs--the beliefs in which I had been bred, the beliefs that until\r\nthen I had never doubted, in that hour of their first trial, were\r\nfalling from me. I could", " might have been a little later. A year or so one\r\nway or the other, what does it matter? And it is only for a little\r\nwhile, Paul. We shall meet again.”\r\n\r\nBut I could not answer him, for clutch them to me as I would, all my\r\nbeliefs--the beliefs in which I had been bred, the beliefs that until\r\nthen I had never doubted, in that hour of their first trial, were\r\nfalling from me. I could not even pray. If I could have prayed for\r\nanything, it would have been for my father's life. But if prayer were\r\nall powerful, as they said, would our loved ones ever die? Man has not\r\nfaith enough, they would explain; if he had there would be no parting.\r\nSo the Lord jests with His creatures, offering with the one hand to\r\nsnatch back with the other. I flung the mockery from me. There was no\r\nfirm foothold anywhere. What were all the religions of the word but\r\nnarcotics with which Humanity seeks to dull its pain, drugs in which it\r\ndrowns its terrors, faith but a bubble that death pricks.\r\n\r\nI do not mean my thoughts took this form. I was little more than a lad,\r\nand to the young all thought is dumb, speaking only with a cry. But they\r\nwere there, vague, inarticulate. Thoughts do not come to us as we grow\r\nolder. They are with us all our lives. We learn their language, that is\r\nall.\r\n\r\nOne fair still evening it burst from me. We had lingered in the Park\r\nlonger than usual, slowly pacing the broad avenue leading from the\r\nObservatory to the Heath. I poured forth all my doubts and fears--that\r\nhe was leaving me for ever, that I should never see him again, I could\r\nnot believe. What could I do to believe?\r\n\r\n“I am glad you have spoken, Paul,” he said, “it would have been sad had\r\nwe parted not understanding each other. It has been my fault. I did not\r\nknow you had these doubts. They come to all of us sooner or later. But\r\nwe hide them from one another. It is foolish.”\r\n\r\n“But tell me,” I cried, “what can I do? How can I make myself believe?”\r\n\r\n“My dear lad,” answered my father, “how can it matter what we believe or\r\ndisbelieve? It will not alter God's facts. Would you liken Him to some\r\nirritable schoolmaster, angry because you cannot understand him?”\r\n\r\n“What do you believe,” I asked, “father, really I mean.”\r\n\r\nThe night had fallen. My father put his arm round me and drew me to him.\r\n\r\n“That we are God's children, little brother,” he answered, “that what He\r\nwills for us is best. It may be life, it may be sleep; it will be best.\r\nI cannot think that He will let us die: that were to think of Him as\r\nwithout purpose. But His uses may not be our desires. We must trust Him.\r\n'Though He slay me yet will I trust in Him.'”\r\n\r\nWe walked awhile in silence before my father spoke again.\r\n\r\n“'Now abideth these three, Faith, Hope and Charity'--you remember\r\nthe verse--Faith in God's goodness to us, Hope that our dreams may\r\nbe fulfiled. But these concern but ourselves--the greatest of all is\r\nCharity.”\r\n\r\nOut of the night-shrouded human hive beneath our feet shone here and\r\nthere a point of light.\r\n\r\n“Be kind, that is all it means,” continued my father. “Often we do what\r\nwe think right, and evil comes of it, and out of evil comes good. We\r\ncannot understand--maybe the old laws we have misread. But the new Law,\r\nthat we love one another--all creatures He has made; that is so clear.\r\nAnd if it be that we are here together only for a little while, Paul,\r\nthe future dark, how much the greater need have we of one another.”\r\n\r\nI looked up into my father's face, and the peace that shone from it slid\r\ninto my soul and gave me strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nOF THE FASHIONING OF PAUL.\r\n\r\nLoves of my youth, whither are ye vanished? Tubby of the golden locks;\r\nLangley of the dented nose; Shamus stout of heart but faint of limb,\r\neasy enough to “down,” but utterly impossible to make to cry: “I give\r\nyou best;” Neal the thin; and Dicky, “dicky Dick” the fat; Ballett of\r\nthe weeping eye; Beau Bunnie lord of many ties, who always fought in\r\nblack kid gloves; all ye others, ye whose names I cannot recollect,\r\nthough I well remember ye were very dear to me, whither are ye vanished,\r\nwhere haunt your creeping ghosts? Had one told me then there would come\r\na day I should never see again your merry faces, never hear your wild,\r\nshrill whoop of greeting, never feel again the warm clasp of your inky\r\nfingers, never fight again nor quarrel with you, never hate you, never\r\nlove you, could I then have borne the thought, I wonder?\r\n\r\nOnce, methinks, not long ago, I saw you, Tubby, you with whom so often\r\nI discovered the North Pole, probed the problem of the sources of the\r\nNile, (Have you forgotten, Tubby, our secret camping ground beside the\r\nlonely waters of the Regent's Park canal, where discussing our frugal\r\nmeal of toasted elephant's tongue--by the uninitiated mistakable for\r\njumbles--there would break upon our trained hunters' ear the hungry\r\nlion or tiger's distant roar, mingled with the melancholy, long-drawn\r\ngrowling of the Polar Bear, growing ever in volume and impatience until\r\nhalf-past four precisely; and we would snatch our rifles, and\r\nwith stealthy tread and every sense alert make our way through the\r\njungle--until stopped by the spiked fencing round the Zoological\r\nGardens?) I feel sure it was you, in spite of your side whiskers and the\r\ngreyness and the thinness of your once clustering golden locks. You were\r\nhurrying down Throgmorton Street chained to a small black bag. I should\r\nhave stopped you, but that I had no time to spare, having to catch a\r\ntrain at Liverpool Street and to get shaved on the way. I wonder if\r\nyou recognised me: you looked at me a little hard, I thought. Gallant,\r\nkindly hearted Shamus, you who fought once for half an hour to save\r\na frog from being skinned; they tell me you are now an Income Tax\r\nassessor; a man, it is reported, with power of disbelief unusual among\r\neven Inland Revenue circles; of little faith, lacking in the charity\r\nthat thinketh no evil. May Providence direct you to other districts than\r\nto mine.\r\n\r\nSo Time, Nature's handy-man, bustles to and fro about the many rooms,\r\nmaking all things tidy, covers with sweet earth the burnt volcanoes,\r\nturns to use the debris of the ages, smoothes again the ground above the\r\ndead, heals again the beech bark marred by lovers.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning I was far from being a favourite with my schoolmates,\r\nand this was the first time trouble came to dwell with me. Later, we men\r\nand women generally succeed in convincing ourselves that whatever else\r\nwe may have missed in life, popularity in a greater or less degree\r\nwe have at all events secured, for without it altogether few of us, I\r\nthink, would care to face existence. But where the child suffers keener\r\nthan the man is in finding himself exposed to the cold truth without the\r\nprotecting clothes of self-deception. My ostracism was painfully plain\r\nto me, and, as was my nature, I brooded upon it in silence.\r\n\r\n“Can you run?” asked of me one day a most important personage whose name\r\nI have forgotten. He was head of the Lower Fourth, a tall youth with a\r\nnose like a beak, and the manner of one born to authority. He was the\r\nson of a draper in the Edgware Road, and his father failing, he had\r\nto be content for a niche in life with a lower clerkship in the Civil\r\nService. But to us youngsters he always appeared a Duke of", " asked of me one day a most important personage whose name\r\nI have forgotten.

He was the\r\nson of a draper in the Edgware Road, and his father failing, he had\r\nto be content for a niche in life with a lower clerkship in the Civil\r\nService. But to us youngsters he always appeared a Duke of Wellington in\r\nembryo, and under other circumstances might, perhaps, have become one.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered. As a matter of fact it was my one accomplishment, and\r\nrumour of it maybe had reached him.\r\n\r\n“Run round the playground twice at your fastest,” he commanded; “let me\r\nsee you.”\r\n\r\nI clinched my fists and charged off. How grateful I was to him for\r\nhaving spoken to me, the outcast of the class, thus publicly, I could\r\nonly show by my exertions to please him. When I drew up before him I was\r\npanting hard, but I could see that he was satisfied.\r\n\r\n“Why don't the fellows like you?” he asked bluntly.\r\n\r\nIf only I could have stepped out of my shyness, spoken my real thoughts!\r\n“O Lord of the Lower Fourth! You upon whom success--the only success in\r\nlife worth having--has fallen as from the laps of the gods! You to whom\r\nall Lower Fourth hearts turn! tell me the secret of this popularity. How\r\nmay I acquire it? No price can be too great for me to pay for it. Vain\r\nlittle egoist that I am, it is the sum of my desires, and will be till\r\nthe long years have taught me wisdom. The want of it embitters all my\r\ndays. Why does silence fall upon their chattering groups when I draw\r\nnear? Why do they drive me from their games? What is it shuts me out\r\nfrom them, repels them from me? I creep into the corners and shed\r\nscalding tears of shame. I watch with envious eyes and ears all you\r\nto whom the wondrous gift is given. What is your secret? Is it Tommy's\r\nswagger? Then I will swagger, too, with anxious heart, with mingled fear\r\nand hope. But why--why, seeing that in Tommy they admire it, do they\r\nwait for me with imitations of cock-a-doodle-do, strut beside me\r\nmimicking a pouter pigeon? Is it Dicky's playfulness?--Dicky, who runs\r\naway with their balls, snatches their caps from off their heads, springs\r\nupon their backs when they are least expecting it?\r\n\r\n“Why should Dicky's reward be laughter, and mine a bloody nose and a\r\nwidened, deepened circle of dislike? I am no heavier than Dicky; if\r\nanything a pound or two lighter. Is it Billy's friendliness? I too\r\nwould fling my arms about their necks; but from me they angrily wrench\r\nthemselves free. Is indifference the best plan? I walk apart with step I\r\ntry so hard to render careless; but none follows, no little friendly\r\narm is slipped through mine. Should one seek to win one's way by kind\r\noffices? Ah, if one could! How I would fag for them. I could do their\r\nsums for them--I am good at sums--write their impositions for them,\r\ngladly take upon myself their punishments, would they but return\r\nmy service with a little love and--more important still--a little\r\nadmiration.”\r\n\r\nBut all I could find to say was, sulkily: “They do like me, some of\r\nthem.” I dared not, aloud, acknowledge the truth.\r\n\r\n“Don't tell lies,” he answered; “you know they don't--none of them.” And\r\nI hung my head.\r\n\r\n“I'll tell you what I'll do,” he continued in his lordly way; “I'll give\r\nyou a chance. We're starting hare and hounds next Saturday; you can be a\r\nhare. You needn't tell anybody. Just turn up on Saturday and I'll see to\r\nit. Mind, you'll have to run like the devil.”\r\n\r\nHe walked away without waiting for my answer, leaving me to meet Joy\r\nrunning towards me with outstretched hands. The great moment comes\r\nto all of us; to the politician, when the Party whip slips from\r\nconfabulation with the Front Bench to congratulate him, smiling, on his\r\nreally admirable little speech; to the youthful dramatist, reading in\r\nhis bed-sitting-room the managerial note asking him to call that morning\r\nat eleven; to the subaltern, beckoned to the stirrup of his chief--the\r\nmoment when the sun breaks through the morning mists, and the world lies\r\nstretched before us, our way clear.\r\n\r\nObeying orders, I gave no hint in school of the great fortune that had\r\ncome to me; but hurrying home, I exploded in the passage before the\r\nfront door could be closed behind me.\r\n\r\n“I am to be a hare because I run so fast. Anybody can be a hound, but\r\nthere's only two hares, and they all want me. And can I have a jersey?\r\nWe begin next Saturday. He saw me run. I ran twice round the playground.\r\nHe said I was splendid! Of course, it's a great honour to be a hare. We\r\nstart from Hampstead Heath. And may I have a pair of shoes?”\r\n\r\nThe jersey and the shoes my mother and I purchased that very day, for\r\nthe fear was upon me that unless we hastened, the last blue and white\r\nstriped jersey in London might be sold, and the market be empty of\r\nrunning shoes. That evening, before getting into bed, I dressed myself\r\nin full costume to admire myself before the glass; and from then till\r\nthe end of the week, to the terror of my mother, I practised leaping\r\nover chairs, and my method of descending stairs was perilous and\r\nroundabout. But, as I explained to them, the credit of the Lower\r\nFourth was at stake, and banisters and legs equally of small account\r\nas compared with fame and honour; and my father, nodding his head,\r\nsupported me with manly argument; but my mother added to her prayers\r\nanother line.\r\n\r\nSaturday came. The members of the hunt were mostly boys who lived in the\r\nneighbourhood; so the arrangement was that at half-past two we should\r\nmeet at the turnpike gate outside the Spaniards. I brought my lunch with\r\nme and ate it in Regent's Park, and then took the 'bus to the Heath. One\r\nby one the others came up. Beyond mere glances, none of them took any\r\nnotice of me. I was wearing my ordinary clothes over my jersey. I knew\r\nthey thought I had come merely to see them start, and I hugged to myself\r\nthe dream of the surprise that was in store for them, and of which I\r\nshould be the hero. He came, one of the last, our leader and chief, and\r\nI sidled up behind him and waited, while he busied himself organising\r\nand constructing.\r\n\r\n“But we've only got one hare,” cried one of them. “We ought to have two,\r\nyou know, in case one gets blown.”\r\n\r\n“We've got two,” answered the Duke. “Think I don't know what I'm about?\r\nYoung Kelver's going to be the other one.”\r\n\r\nSilence fell upon the meet.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I say, we don't want him,” at last broke in a voice. “He's a muff.”\r\n\r\n“He can run,” explained the Duke.\r\n\r\n“Let him run home,” came another voice, which was greeted with laughter.\r\n\r\n“You'll run home in a minute yourself,” threatened the Duke, “if I have\r\nany of your cheek. Who's captain here--you or me? Now, young 'un, are\r\nyou ready?”\r\n\r\nI had commenced unbuttoning my jacket, but my hands fell to my side. “I\r\ndon't want to come,” I answered, “if they don't want me.”\r\n\r\n“He'll get his feet wet,” suggested the boy who had spoken first. “Don't\r\nspoil him, he's his mother's pet.”\r\n\r\n“Are you coming or are you not?” shouted the Duke, seeing me still\r\nmotionless. But the tears were coming into my eyes and would not go\r\nback. I turned my face", ", but my hands fell to my side. “I\r\ndon't want to come,” I answered, “if they don't want me.”\r\n\r\n“He'll get his feet wet,” suggested the boy who had spoken first. “Don't\r\nspoil him, he's his mother's pet.”\r\n\r\n“Are you coming or are you not?” shouted the Duke, seeing me still\r\nmotionless. But the tears were coming into my eyes and would not go\r\nback. I turned my face away without speaking.\r\n\r\n“All right, stop then,” cried the Duke, who, like all authoritative\r\npeople, was impatient above all things of hesitation. “Here, Keefe, you\r\ntake the bag and be off. It'll be dark before we start.”\r\n\r\nMy substitute snatched eagerly at the chance, and away went the hares,\r\nwhile I, still keeping my face hid, moved slowly off.\r\n\r\n“Cry-baby!” shouted a sharp-eyed youngster.\r\n\r\n“Let him alone,” growled the Duke; and I went on to where the cedars\r\ngrew.\r\n\r\nI heard them start off a few minutes later with a whoop. How could I go\r\nhome, confess my disappointment, my shame? My father would be expecting\r\nme with many questions, my mother waiting for me with hot water and\r\nblankets. What explanation could I give that would not betray my\r\nmiserable secret?\r\n\r\nIt was a chill, dismal afternoon, the Heath deserted, a thin rain\r\ncommencing. I slipped off my shirt and jacket, and rolling them under my\r\narm, trotted off alone, hare and hounds combined in one small carcass,\r\nto chase myself sadly by myself.\r\n\r\nI see it still, that pathetically ridiculous little figure, jogging\r\ndoggedly over the dank fields. Mile after mile it runs, the little\r\nidiot; jumping--sometimes falling into the muddy ditches: it seems\r\nanxious rather than otherwise to get itself into a mess; scrambling\r\nthrough the dripping hedges; swarming over tarry fence and slimy paling.\r\nOn, on it pants--through Bishop's Wood, by tangled Churchyard Bottom,\r\nwhere now the railway shrieks; down sloppy lanes, bordering Muswell\r\nHill, where now stand rows of jerry-built, prim villas. At intervals\r\nit stops an instant to dab its eyes with its dingy little rag of a\r\nhandkerchief, to rearrange the bundle under its arm, its chief anxiety\r\nto keep well out of sight of chance wanderers, to dodge farmhouses, to\r\ndart across highroads when nobody is looking. And so tear-smeared and\r\nmud-bespattered up the long rise of darkening Crouch End Lane, where\r\nto-night the electric light blazes from a hundred shops, and dead\r\nbeat into the Seven Sisters Road station, there to tear off its soaked\r\njersey; and then home to Poplar, with shameless account of the jolly\r\nafternoon that it has spent, of the admiration and the praise that it\r\nhas won.\r\n\r\nYou poor, pitiful little brat! Popularity? it is a shadow. Turn your\r\neyes towards it, and it shall ever run before you, escaping you. Turn\r\nyour back upon it, walk joyously towards the living sun, and it shall\r\nfollow you. Am I not right? Why, then, do you look at me, your little\r\nface twisted into that quizzical grin?\r\n\r\nWhen one takes service with Deceit, one signs a contract that one may\r\nnot break but under penalty. Maybe it was good for my health, those\r\nlonely runs; but oh, they were dreary! By a process of argument not\r\nuncommon I persuaded myself that truth was a matter of mere words, that\r\nso long as I had actually gone over the ground I described I was not\r\nlying. To further satisfy my conscience, I bought a big satchel and\r\nscattered from it torn-up paper as I ran.\r\n\r\n“And they never catch you?” asked my mother.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, never; they never even get within sight of me.”\r\n\r\n“Be careful, dear,” would advise my mother; “don't overstrain yourself.”\r\n But I could see that she was proud of me.\r\n\r\nAnd after awhile imagination came to my help, so that often I could hear\r\nbehind me the sound of pursuing feet, catch through gaps in the trees a\r\nsight of a merry, host upon my trail, and would redouble my speed.\r\n\r\nThus, but for Dan, my loneliness would have been unbearable. His\r\nfriendship was always there for me to creep to, the shadow of a great\r\nrock in a weary land. To this day one may always know Dan's politics:\r\nthey are those of the Party out of power. Always without question one\r\nmay know the cause that he will champion, the unpopular cause; the man\r\nhe will defend, the man who is down.\r\n\r\n“You are such an un-understandable chap,” complained a fellow Clubman to\r\nhim once in my hearing. “I sometimes ask myself if you have any opinions\r\nat all.”\r\n\r\n“I hate a crowd,” was Dan's only confession of faith.\r\n\r\nHe never claimed anything from me in return for his affection; he was\r\nthere for me to hold to when I wanted him. When, baffled in all my\r\nattempts to win the affections of others, I returned to him for comfort,\r\nhe gave it me, without even relieving himself of friendly advice. When\r\nat length childish success came to me and I needed him less, he was\r\nneither hurt nor surprised. Other people--their thoughts, their actions,\r\neven when these concerned himself--never troubled him. He loved to\r\nbestow, but as to response was strangely indifferent; indeed, if\r\nanything, it bored him. His nature appeared to be that of the fountain,\r\nwhich fulfils itself by giving, but is unable to receive.\r\n\r\nMy popularity came to me unexpectedly after I had given up hoping for\r\nit; surprising me, annoying me. Gradually it dawned upon me that my\r\ncompany was being sought.\r\n\r\n“Come along, Kelver,” would say the spokesman of one group; “we're going\r\npart of your way home. You can walk with us.”\r\n\r\nMaybe I would go with them, but more often, before we reached the gate,\r\nthe delight of my society would be claimed by a rival troop.\r\n\r\n“He's coming with us this afternoon. He promised.”\r\n\r\n“No, he didn't.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he did.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he ain't, anyhow. See?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, isn't he? Who says he isn't?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“Punch his head, Dick!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you do, Jimmy Blake, and I'll punch yours. Come, Kelver.”\r\n\r\nI might have been some Queen of Beauty offered as prize for knightly\r\ncontest. Indeed, more than once the argument concluded thus primitively,\r\nI being carried off in triumph by the victorious party.\r\n\r\nFor a period it remained a mystery to me, until I asked explanation of\r\nNorval--we called him “Norval,” he being one George Grampian: it was our\r\nwit. From taking joy in teasing me, Norval had suddenly become one of my\r\ngreatest admirers. This by itself was difficult enough to understand.\r\nHe was in the second eleven, and after Dan the best fighter in the lower\r\nschool. If I could understand Norval's change of attitude all would be\r\nplain to me; so when next time, bounding upon me in the cloakroom and\r\nslipping his arm into mine, he clamoured for my company to Camden Town,\r\nI put the question to him bluntly.\r\n\r\n“Why should I walk home with you? Why do you want me?”\r\n\r\n“Because we like you.”\r\n\r\n“But why do you like me?”\r\n\r\n“Why! Why, because you're such a funny chap. You say such funny things.”\r\n\r\nIt struck me like a slap in the face. I had thought to reach popularity\r\nupon the ladder of heroic qualities. In all the school books I had read,\r\nLeonard or Marmaduke (we had a Marmaduke in the Lower Fifth--they\r\ncalled him Marmalade: in the school books these disasters are not\r\ncontemplated), won love and admiration by reason of integrity of\r\ncharacter, nobility of sentiment, goodness of heart, brilliance of\r\nintellect; combined maybe with a certain amount of agility, instinct in\r\nthe direction of bowling, or aptitude for jumping; but such only by the\r\nway. Not one of them had ever said a funny thing,", " Marmaduke in the Lower Fifth--they\r\ncalled him Marmalade: in the school books these disasters are not\r\ncontemplated), won love and admiration by reason of integrity of\r\ncharacter, nobility of sentiment, goodness of heart, brilliance of\r\nintellect; combined maybe with a certain amount of agility, instinct in\r\nthe direction of bowling, or aptitude for jumping; but such only by the\r\nway. Not one of them had ever said a funny thing, either consciously or\r\nunconsciously.\r\n\r\n“Don't be disagreeable, Kelver. Come with us and we will let you into\r\nthe team as an extra. I'll teach you batting.”\r\n\r\nSo I was to be their Fool--I, dreamer of knightly dreams, aspirant to\r\nhero's fame! I craved their wonder; I had won their laughter. I had\r\nprayed for popularity; it had been granted to me--in this guise. Were\r\nthe gods still the heartless practical jokers poor Midas had found them?\r\n\r\nHad my vanity been less I should have flung their gift back in their\r\nfaces. But my thirst for approbation was too intense. I had to choose:\r\nCut capers and be followed, or walk in dignity, ignored. I chose to cut\r\nthe capers. As time wore on I found myself striving to cut them quicker,\r\nquainter, thinking out funny stories, preparing ingenuous impromptus,\r\ntwisting all ideas into odd expression.\r\n\r\nI had my reward. Before long my company was desired by all the school.\r\nBut I was never content. I would rather have been the Captain of their\r\nfootball club, even his deputy Vice; would have given all my meed of\r\nlaughter for stuttering Jerry's one round of applause when in our match\r\nagainst Highbury he knocked up his century, and so won the victory for\r\nus by just three.\r\n\r\nTill the end I never quite abandoned hope of exchanging my vine leaves\r\nfor the laurels. I would rise an hour earlier in the morning to practise\r\nthrowing at broomsticks set up in waste places. At another time, the\r\nsport coming into temporary fashion, I wearied body and mind for weeks\r\nin vain attempts to acquire skill on stilts. That even fat Tubby could\r\nout-distance me upon them saddened my life for months.\r\n\r\nA lad there was, a Sixth Form boy, one Wakeham by name, if I remember\r\nrightly, who greatly envied me my gift of being able to amuse. He was of\r\nthe age when the other sex begins to be of importance to a fellow, and\r\nthe desire had come to him to be regarded as a star of wit among\r\nthe social circles of Gospel Oak. Need I say that by nature he was a\r\nponderously dull boy.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon I happened to be the centre of a small group in the\r\nplayground. I had been holding forth and they had been laughing. Whether\r\nI had delivered myself of anything really entertaining or not I cannot\r\nsay. It made no difference; they had got into the habit of laughing when\r\nI talked. Sometimes I would say quite serious things on purpose; they\r\nwould laugh just the same. Wakeham was among them, his eyes fixed on me,\r\nwatching me as boys watch a conjurer in the hope of finding out “how he\r\ndoes it.” Later in the afternoon he slipped his arm through mine, and\r\ndrew me away into an empty corner of the ground.\r\n\r\n“I say, Kelver,” he broke out, the moment we were beyond hearing, “you\r\nreally are funny!”\r\n\r\nIt gave me no pleasure. If he had told me that he admired my bowling I\r\nmight not have believed him, but should have loved him for it.\r\n\r\n“So are you,” I answered savagely, “only you don't know it.”\r\n\r\n“No, I'm not,” he replied. “Wish I was. I say, Kelver”--he glanced round\r\nto see that no one was within earshot--“do you think you could teach me\r\nto be funny?”\r\n\r\nI was about to reply with conviction in the negative when an idea\r\noccurred to me. Wakeham was famous among us for one thing; he could,\r\ninserting two fingers in his mouth, produce a whistle capable of\r\nconfusing dogs a quarter of a mile off, and of causing people near at\r\nhand to jump from six to eighteen inches into the air.\r\n\r\nThis accomplishment of his I envied him as keenly as he envied me mine.\r\nI did not admire it; I could not see the use of it. Generally speaking,\r\nit called forth irritation rather than affection. A purple-faced old\r\ngentleman, close to whose ear he once performed, promptly cuffed his\r\nhead for it; and for so doing was commended by the whole street as a\r\npublic benefactor. Drivers of vehicles would respond by flicking at him,\r\noccasionally with success. Even youth, from whom sympathy might have\r\nbeen expected, appeared impelled, if anything happened to be at all\r\nhandy, to take it up and throw it at him. My own social circle would,\r\nI knew, regard it as a vulgar accomplishment, and even Wakeham himself\r\ndared not perform it in the hearing of his own classmates. That any\r\nhuman being should have desired to acquire it seems incomprehensible.\r\nYet for weeks in secret I had wrestled to produce the hideous sound.\r\nWhy? For three reasons, so far as I can analyse this youngster of whom I\r\nam writing:\r\n\r\nFirstly, here was a means of attracting attention; secondly, it was\r\nsomething that somebody else could do and that he couldn't; thirdly, it\r\nwas a thing for which he evidently had no natural aptitude whatever, and\r\ntherefore a thing to acquire which his soul yearned the more. Had a boy\r\ncome across his path, clever at walking on his hands with his heels in\r\nthe air, Master Paul Kelver would in all probability have broken his\r\nneck in attempts to copy and excel. I make no apologies for the brat:\r\nI merely present him as a study for the amusement of a world of wiser\r\nboys--and men.\r\n\r\nI struck a bargain with young Wakeham; I undertook to teach him to be\r\nfunny in return for his teaching me this costermonger's whistle.\r\n\r\nEach of us strove conscientiously to impart knowledge. Neither of us\r\nsucceeded. Wakeham tried hard to be funny; I tried hard to whistle. He\r\ndid all I told him; I followed his instructions implicitly. The result\r\nwas the feeblest of wit and the feeblest of whistles.\r\n\r\n“Do you think anybody would laugh at that?” Wakeham would pathetically\r\nenquire at the termination of his supremest effort. And honestly I would\r\nhave to confess I did not think any living being would.\r\n\r\n“How far off do you think any one could hear that?” I would demand\r\nanxiously, on recovering sufficient breath to speak at all.\r\n\r\n“Well, it would depend upon whether you knew it was coming,” Wakeham\r\nwould reply kindly, not wishing to discourage me.\r\n\r\nWe abandoned the scheme by mutual consent at about the end of a\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\n“I suppose it's something that you've got to have inside you,” I\r\nsuggested to Wakeham in consolation.\r\n\r\n“I don't think the roof of your mouth can be quite the right shape for\r\nit,” concluded Wakeham.\r\n\r\nMy success as story-teller, commentator, critic, jester, revived\r\nmy childish ambition towards authorship. My first stirrings in this\r\ndirection I cannot rightly place. I remember when very small falling\r\ninto a sunk dust-bin--a deep hole, rather, into which the gardener shot\r\nhis rubbish. The fall twisted my ankle so that I could not move; and\r\nthe time being evening and my prison some distance from the house, my\r\npredicament loomed large before me. Yet one consolation remained with\r\nme: the incident would be of value to me in the autobiography upon which\r\nI was then engaged. I can distinctly recollect lying on my back among\r\ndecaying leaves and broken glass, framing my account. “On this day a\r\nstrange adventure befell me. Walking in the garden, all unheeding, I\r\nsuddenly”--I did not want to add the truth--“tumbled into a dust-hole,\r\nsix feet square, that any one but a moon calf might have seen.” I\r\npuzzled to evolve a more dignified situation. The dust-bin became a\r\ncavern, the entrance to which had been artfully concealed", " and broken glass, framing my account. “On this day a\r\nstrange adventure befell me. Walking in the garden, all unheeding, I\r\nsuddenly”--I did not want to add the truth--“tumbled into a dust-hole,\r\nsix feet square, that any one but a moon calf might have seen.” I\r\npuzzled to evolve a more dignified situation. The dust-bin became a\r\ncavern, the entrance to which had been artfully concealed; the six or\r\nseven feet I had really fallen, “an endless descent, terminating in a\r\nvast and gloomy chamber.” I was divided between opposing desires: One,\r\nfor rescue followed by sympathy and supper; the other, for the alarming\r\nexperience of a night of terror where I lay. Nature conquering Art,\r\nI yelled; and the episode terminated prosaically with a warm bath and\r\narnica. But from it I judge that desire for the woes and perils of\r\nauthorship was with me somewhat early.\r\n\r\nOf my many other dreams I would speak freely, discussing them at length\r\nwith sympathetic souls, but concerning this one ambition I was curiously\r\nreticent. Only to two--my mother and a grey-bearded Stranger--did I\r\never breathe a word of it. Even from my father I kept it a secret, close\r\ncomrades in all else though we were. He would have talked of it much and\r\nfreely, dragged it into the light of day; and from this I shrank.\r\n\r\nMy talk with the Stranger came about in this wise. One evening I had\r\ntaken a walk to Victoria Park--a favourite haunt of mine at summer time.\r\nIt was a fair and peaceful evening, and I fell a-wandering there in\r\npleasant reverie, until the waning light hinted to me the question of\r\ntime. I looked about me. Only one human being was in sight, a man with\r\nhis back towards me, seated upon a bench overlooking the ornamental\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nI drew nearer. He took no notice of me, and interested--though why, I\r\ncould not say--I seated myself beside him at the other end of the bench.\r\nHe was a handsome, distinguished-looking man, with wonderfully bright,\r\nclear eyes and iron-grey hair and beard. I might have thought him a sea\r\ncaptain, of whom many were always to be met with in that neighbourhood,\r\nbut for his hands, which were crossed upon his stick, and which were\r\nwhite and delicate as a woman's. He turned his face and glanced at me.\r\nI fancied that his lips beneath the grey moustache smiled; and\r\ninstinctively I edged a little nearer to him.\r\n\r\n“Please, sir,” I said, after awhile, “could you tell me the right time?”\r\n\r\n“Twenty minutes to eight,” he answered, looking at his watch. And his\r\nvoice drew me towards him even more than had his beautiful strong face.\r\nI thanked him, and we fell back into silence.\r\n\r\n“Where do you live?” he turned and suddenly asked me.\r\n\r\n“Oh, only over there,” I answered, with a wave of my arm towards the\r\nchimney-fringed horizon behind us. “I needn't be in till half-past\r\neight. I like this Park so much,” I added, “I often come and sit here of\r\nan evening.'\r\n\r\n“Why do you like to come and sit here?” he asked. “Tell me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don't know,” I answered. “I think.”\r\n\r\nI marvelled at myself. With strangers generally I was shy and silent;\r\nbut the magic of his bright eyes seemed to have loosened my tongue.\r\n\r\nI told him my name; that we lived in a street always full of ugly\r\nsounds, so that a gentleman could not think, not even in the evening\r\ntime, when Thought goes a-visiting.\r\n\r\n“Mamma does not like the twilight time,” I confided to him. “It always\r\nmakes her cry. But then mamma is--not very young, you know, and has had\r\na deal of trouble; and that makes a difference, I suppose.”\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand upon mine. We were sitting nearer to each other now.\r\n“God made women weak to teach us men to be tender,” he said. “But you,\r\nPaul, like this 'twilight time'?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “very much. Don't you?”\r\n\r\n“And why do you like it?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” I answered, “things come to you.”\r\n\r\n“What things?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, fancies,” I explained to him. “I am going to be an author when I\r\ngrow up, and write books.”\r\n\r\nHe took my hand in his and shook it gravely, and then returned it to me.\r\n“I, too, am a writer of books,” he said.\r\n\r\nAnd then I knew what had drawn me to him.\r\n\r\nSo for the first time I understood the joy of talking “shop” with a\r\nfellow craftsman. I told him my favourite authors--Scott, and Dumas,\r\nand Victor Hugo; and to my delight found they were his also; he agreeing\r\nwith me that real stories were the best, stories in which people did\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n“I used to read silly stuff once,” I confessed, “Indian tales and that\r\nsort of thing, you know. But mamma said I'd never be able to write if I\r\nread that rubbish.”\r\n\r\n“You will find it so all through life, Paul,” he replied. “The things\r\nthat are nice are rarely good for us. And what do you read now?”\r\n\r\n“I am reading Marlowe's Plays and De Quincey's Confessions just now,” I\r\nconfided to him.\r\n\r\n“And do you understand them?”\r\n\r\n“Fairly well,” I answered. “Mamma says I'll like them better as I go\r\non. I want to learn to write very, very well indeed,” I admitted to him;\r\n“then I'll be able to earn heaps of money.”\r\n\r\nHe smiled. “So you don't believe in Art for Art's sake, Paul?”\r\n\r\nI was puzzled. “What does that mean?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“It means in our case, Paul,” he answered, “writing books for the\r\npleasure of writing books, without thinking of any reward, without\r\ndesiring either money or fame.”\r\n\r\nIt was a new idea to me. “Do many authors do that?” I asked.\r\n\r\nHe laughed outright this time. It was a delightful laugh. It rang\r\nthrough the quiet Park, awaking echoes; and caught by it, I laughed with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” he said; and he glanced round with a whimsical expression of\r\nfear, lest we might have been overheard. “Between ourselves, Paul,” he\r\ncontinued, drawing me more closely towards him and whispering, “I don't\r\nthink any of us do. We talk about it. But I'll tell you this, Paul; it\r\nis a trade secret and you must remember it: No man ever made money or\r\nfame but by writing his very best. It may not be as good as somebody\r\nelse's best, but it is his best. Remember that, Paul.”\r\n\r\nI promised I would.\r\n\r\n“And you must not think merely of the money and the fame, Paul,” he\r\nadded the next moment, speaking more seriously. “Money and fame are very\r\ngood things, and only hypocrites pretend to despise them. But if you\r\nwrite books thinking only of money, you will be disappointed. It is\r\nearned easier in other ways. Tell me, that is not your only idea?”\r\n\r\nI pondered. “Mamma says it is a very noble calling, authorship,” I\r\nremembered, “and that any one ought to be very proud and glad to be able\r\nto write books, because they give people happiness and make them forget\r\nthings; and that one ought to be very good if one is going to be an\r\nauthor, so as to be worthy to help and teach others.”\r\n\r\n“And do you try to be good, Paul?” he enquired.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered; “but it's very hard to be quite good--until of course\r\nyou're grown up.”\r\n\r\nHe smiled, but more to himself than to me. “Yes,” he said, “I suppose it\r\nis difficult to be good until you are grown up. Perhaps we shall all of\r\nus be good when we're quite grown up.” Which, from a gentleman with a\r\ngrey beard, appeared to me a puzzling observation.\r\n\r\n“And what else does mamma say about literature?” he asked. “Can you\r\nremember?”\r\n\r\nAgain I ponder", "until of course\r\nyou're grown up.”\r\n\r\nHe smiled, but more to himself than to me. “Yes,” he said, “I suppose it\r\nis difficult to be good until you are grown up. Perhaps we shall all of\r\nus be good when we're quite grown up.” Which, from a gentleman with a\r\ngrey beard, appeared to me a puzzling observation.\r\n\r\n“And what else does mamma say about literature?” he asked. “Can you\r\nremember?”\r\n\r\nAgain I pondered, and her words came back to me. “That he who can write\r\na great book is greater than a king; that the gift of being able to\r\nwrite is given to anybody in trust; that an author should never forget\r\nhe is God's servant.”\r\n\r\nHe sat for awhile without speaking, his chin resting on his folded hands\r\nsupported by his gold-topped cane. Then he turned and laid a hand upon\r\nmy shoulder, and his clear, bright eyes were close to mine.\r\n\r\n“Your mother is a wise lady, Paul,” he said. “Remember her words always.\r\nIn later life let them come back to you; they will guide you better than\r\nthe chatter of the Clubs.”\r\n\r\n“And what modern authors do you read?” he asked after a silence: “any of\r\nthem--Thackeray, Bulwer Lytton, Dickens?”\r\n\r\n“I have read 'The Last of the Barons,'” I told him; “I like that. And\r\nI've been to Barnet and seen the church. And some of Mr. Dickens'.”\r\n\r\n“And what do you think of Mr. Dickens?” he asked. But he did not seem\r\nvery interested in the subject. He had picked up a few small stones, and\r\nwas throwing them carefully into the water.\r\n\r\n“I like him very much,” I answered; “he makes you laugh.”\r\n\r\n“Not always?” he asked. He stopped his stone-throwing, and turned\r\nsharply towards me.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, not always,” I admitted; “but I like the funny bits best. I\r\nlike so much where Mr. Pickwick--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, damn Mr. Pickwick!” he said.\r\n\r\n“Don't you like him?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I like him well enough, or used to,” he replied; “I'm a bit\r\ntired of him, that's all. Does your mamma like Mr.--Mr. Dickens?”\r\n\r\n“Not the funny parts,” I explained to him. “She thinks he is\r\noccasionally--”\r\n\r\n“I know,” he interrupted, rather irritably, I thought; “a trifle\r\nvulgar.”\r\n\r\nIt surprised me that he should have guessed her exact words. “I don't\r\nthink mamma has much sense of humour,” I explained to him. “Sometimes\r\nshe doesn't even see papa's jokes.”\r\n\r\nAt that he laughed again. “But she likes the other parts?” he enquired,\r\n“the parts where Mr. Dickens isn't--vulgar?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” I answered. “She says he can be so beautiful and tender, when\r\nhe likes.”\r\n\r\nTwilight was deepening. It occurred to me to enquire of him again the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n“Just over the quarter,” he answered, looking at his watch.\r\n\r\n“I'm so sorry,” I said. “I must go now.”\r\n\r\n“So am I sorry, Paul,” he answered. “Perhaps we shall meet again.\r\nGood-bye.” Then as our hands touched: “You have never asked me my name,\r\nPaul,” he reminded me.\r\n\r\n“Oh, haven't I?” I answered.\r\n\r\n“No, Paul,” he replied, “and that makes me think of your future with\r\nhope. You are an egotist, Paul; and that is the beginning of all art.”\r\n\r\nAnd after that he would not tell me his name. “Perhaps next time we\r\nmeet,” he said. “Good-bye, Paul. Good luck to you!”\r\n\r\nSo I went my way. Where the path winds out of sight I turned. He was\r\nstill seated upon the bench, but his face was towards me, and he waved\r\nhis hand to me. I answered with a wave of mine. And then the intervening\r\nboughs and bushes gradually closed in around me. And across the rising\r\nmist there rose the hoarse, harsh cry:\r\n\r\n“All out! All out!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nIN WHICH PAUL IS SHIPWRECKED, AND CAST INTO DEEP WATERS.\r\n\r\nMy father died, curiously enough, on the morning of his birthday. We had\r\nnot expected the end to arrive for some time, and at first did not know\r\nthat it had come.\r\n\r\n“I have left him sleeping,” said my mother, who had slipped out very\r\nquietly in her dressing-gown. “Washburn gave him a draught last night.\r\nWe won't disturb him.”\r\n\r\nSo we sat round the breakfast table, speaking in low tones, for the\r\nhouse was small and flimsy, all sound easily heard through its thin\r\npartitions. Afterwards my mother crept upstairs, I following, and\r\ncautiously opened the door a little way.\r\n\r\nThe blinds were still down, and the room dark. It seemed a long time\r\nthat my mother stood there listening, her ear against the jar. The\r\nfirst costermonger--a girl's voice, it sounded--passed, crying shrilly:\r\n“Watercreases, fine fresh watercreases with your breakfast-a'penny\r\na bundle watercreases;” and further off a hoarse youth was wailing:\r\n“Mee-ilk-mee-ilk-oi.”\r\n\r\nInch by inch my mother opened the door wider and we stole in. He was\r\nlying with his eyes still closed, the lips just slightly parted. I had\r\nnever seen death before, and could not realise it. All that I could see\r\nwas that he looked even younger than I had ever seen him look before.\r\nBy slow degrees only, it came home to me, the knowledge that he was gone\r\naway from us. For days--for weeks, I would hear his step behind me in\r\nthe street, his voice calling to me, see his face among the crowds,\r\nand hastening to meet him, stand bewildered because it had mysteriously\r\ndisappeared. But at first I felt no pain whatever.\r\n\r\nTo my mother it was but a short parting. Into her placid faith had never\r\nfallen fear nor doubt. He was waiting for her. In God's good time they\r\nwould meet again. What need of sorrow! Without him the days passed\r\nslowly: the house must ever be a little dull when the good man's away.\r\nBut that was all. So my mother would speak of him always--of his dear,\r\nkind ways, of his oddities and follies we loved so to recall, not\r\nthrough tears, but smiles, thinking of him not as of one belonging to\r\nthe past, but as of one beckoning to her from the future.\r\n\r\nWe lived on still in the old house though ever planning to move, for\r\nthe great brick monster had crept closer round about us year by year,\r\ndevouring in his progress all things fair. Field and garden, tree and\r\ncottage, time-mellowed house suggesting story, kind hedgerow hiding\r\nhideousness beyond--the few spots yet in that doomed land lingering to\r\nremind one of the sunshine, one by one had he scrunched them between his\r\nugly teeth. A world apart, this east end of London, this ghetto of the\r\npoor for ever growing, dreariness added year by year to dreariness,\r\nhopelessness stretching ever farther its long, shrivelled arms, these\r\nendless rows of reeking cells where London herds her slaves. Often of a\r\nmisty afternoon when we knew that without this city of the dead life was\r\nstirring in the sunshine, we would fare forth to house-hunt in\r\npleasant suburbs, now themselves added to the weary catacomb of narrow\r\nstreets--to Highgate, then a tiny town connected by a coach with leafy\r\nHolloway; to Hampstead with its rows of ancient red-brick houses, from\r\nwhose wind-blown heath one saw beyond the woods and farms, far London's\r\ndomes and spires, to Wood Green among the pastures, where smock-coated\r\nlabourers discussed their politics and ale beneath wide-spreading elms;\r\nto Hornsey, then a village consisting of an ivy-covered church and one\r\ngrass-bordered way. But though we often saw “the very thing for us”", " Hampstead with its rows of ancient red-brick houses, from\r\nwhose wind-blown heath one saw beyond the woods and farms, far London's\r\ndomes and spires, to Wood Green among the pastures, where smock-coated\r\nlabourers discussed their politics and ale beneath wide-spreading elms;\r\nto Hornsey, then a village consisting of an ivy-covered church and one\r\ngrass-bordered way. But though we often saw “the very thing for us” and\r\nwould discuss its possibilities from every point of view and find them\r\ngood, we yet delayed.\r\n\r\n“We must think it over,” would say my mother; “there is no hurry; for\r\nsome reasons I shall be sorry to leave Poplar.”\r\n\r\n“For what reasons, mother?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, no particular reason, Paul. Only we have lived there so long,\r\nyou know. It will be a wrench leaving the old house.”\r\n\r\nTo the making of man go all things, even to the instincts of the\r\nclinging vine. We fling our tendrils round what is the nearest\r\ncastle-keep or pig-stye wall, rain and sunshine fastening them but\r\nfirmer. Dying Sir Walter Scott--do you remember?--hastening home from\r\nItaly, fearful lest he might not be in time to breathe again the damp\r\nmists of the barren hills. An ancient dame I knew, they had carried her\r\nfrom her attic in slumland that she might be fanned by the sea breezes,\r\nand the poor old soul lay pining for what she called her “home.” Wife,\r\nmother, widow, she had lived there till the alley's reek smelt good\r\nto her nostrils, till its riot was the voices of her people. Who shall\r\nunderstand us save He who fashioned us?\r\n\r\nSo the old house held us to its dismal bosom; and not until within its\r\nhomely but unlovely arms, first my aunt, and later on my mother had\r\ndied, and I had said good-bye to Amy, crying in the midst of littered\r\nemptiness, did I leave it.\r\n\r\nMy aunt died as she had lived, grumbling.\r\n\r\n“You will be glad to get rid of me, all of you!” she said, dropping for\r\nthe first and last time I can recollect into the retort direct; “and I\r\ncan't say I shall be very sorry to go myself. It hasn't been my idea of\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\nPoor old lady! That was only a couple of weeks before the end. I do not\r\nsuppose she guessed it was so certain or perhaps she might have been\r\nmore sentimental.\r\n\r\n“Don't be foolish,” said my mother, “you're not going to die!”\r\n\r\n“What's the use of talking like an idiot,” retorted my aunt, “I've got\r\nto do it some time. Why not now, when everything's all ready for it. It\r\nisn't as if I was enjoying myself.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure we do all we can for you,” said my mother. “I know you do,”\r\n replied my aunt. “I'm a burden to you. I always have been.”\r\n\r\n“Not a burden,” corrected my mother.\r\n\r\n“What does the woman call it then,” snapped back my aunt. “Does she\r\nreckon I've been a sunbeam in the house? I've been a trial to everybody.\r\nThat's what I was born for; it's my metier.”\r\n\r\nMy mother put her arms about the poor old soul and kissed her. “We\r\nshould miss you very much,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I'm sure I hope they all will!” answered my aunt. “It's the only thing\r\nI've got to leave 'em, worth having.”\r\n\r\nMy mother laughed.\r\n\r\n“Maybe it's been a good thing for you, Maggie,” grumbled my aunt; “if\r\nit wasn't for cantankerous, disagreeable people like me, gentle, patient\r\npeople like you wouldn't get any practice. Perhaps, after all, I've been\r\na blessing to you in disguise.”\r\n\r\nI cannot honestly say we ever wished her back; though we certainly\r\ndid miss her--missed many a joke at her oddities, many a laugh at her\r\ncornery ways. It takes all sorts, as the saying goes, to make a world.\r\nPossibly enough if only we perfect folk were left in it we would find it\r\nuncomfortably monotonous.\r\n\r\nAs for Amy, I believe she really regretted her.\r\n\r\n“One never knows what's good for one till one's lost it,” sighed Amy.\r\n\r\n“I'm glad to think you liked her,” said my mother.\r\n\r\n“You see, mum,” explained Amy, “I was one of a large family; and a bit\r\nof a row now and again cheers one up, I always think. I'll be losing the\r\npower of my tongue if something doesn't come along soon.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you are going to be married in a few weeks now,” my mother\r\nreminded her.\r\n\r\nBut Amy remained despondent. “They're poor things, the men, at a few\r\nwords, the best of them,” she replied. “As likely as not just when\r\nyou're getting interested you turn round to find that they've put on\r\ntheir hat and gone out.”\r\n\r\nMy mother and I were very much alone after my aunt's death. Barbara had\r\ngone abroad to put the finishing touches to her education--to learn the\r\ntricks of the Nobs' trade, as old Hasluck phrased it; and I had left\r\nschool and taken employment with Mr. Stillwood, without salary, the idea\r\nbeing that I should study for the law.\r\n\r\n“You are in luck's way, my boy, in luck's way,” old Mr. Gadley had\r\nassured me. “To have commenced your career in the office of Stillwood,\r\nWaterhead and Royal will be a passport for you anywhere. It will stamp\r\nyou, my boy.”\r\n\r\nMr. Stillwood himself was an extremely old and feeble gentleman--so old\r\nand feeble it seemed strange that he, a wealthy man, had not long ago\r\nretired.\r\n\r\n“I am always meaning to,” he explained to me one day soon after my\r\nadvent in his office. “When your poor father came to me he told me very\r\nfrankly the sad fact--that he had only a few more years to live. 'Mr.\r\nKelver,' I answered him, 'do not let that trouble you, so far as I am\r\nconcerned. There are one or two matters in the office I should like to\r\nsee cleared up, and in these you can help me. When they are completed I\r\nshall retire! Yet, you see, I linger on. I am like the old hackney coach\r\nhorse, Mr. Weller--or is it Mr. Jingle--tells us of; if the shafts were\r\ndrawn away I should probably collapse. So I jog on, I jog on.'”\r\n\r\nHe had married late in life a common woman much younger than himself,\r\nwho had brought to him a horde of needy and greedy relatives, and no\r\ndoubt, as a refuge from her noisy neighbourhood, the daily peace of\r\nLombard Street was welcome to him. We saw her occasionally. She was\r\none of those blustering, “managing” women who go through life under\r\nthe impression that making a disturbance is somehow “putting things to\r\nrights.” Ridiculously ashamed of her origin, she sought to hide it under\r\nwhat her friends assured her was the air of a duchess, but which, as\r\na matter of fact, resembled rather the Sunday manners of an elderly\r\nbarmaid. Mr. Gadley alone was not afraid of her; but, on the contrary,\r\nkept her always very much in fear of him, often speaking to her with\r\nrefreshing candour. He had known her in the days it was her desire\r\nshould be buried in oblivion, and had always resented as a personal\r\ninsult her entry into the old established aristocratic firm of Stillwood\r\n& Co.\r\n\r\nHer history was peculiar. Mr. Stillwood, when a blase man about\r\ntown, verging on forty, had first seen her, then a fair-haired,\r\nethereal-looking child, in spite of her dirt, playing in the gutter. To\r\nhis lasting self-reproach it was young Gadley himself, accompanying his\r\nemployer home from Westminster, who had drawn Mr. Stillwood's attention\r\nto the girl by boxing her ears for having, as he passed, slapped his\r\nface with a convenient", ". Mr. Stillwood, when a blase man about\r\ntown, verging on forty, had first seen her, then a fair-haired,\r\nethereal-looking child, in spite of her dirt, playing in the gutter. To\r\nhis lasting self-reproach it was young Gadley himself, accompanying his\r\nemployer home from Westminster, who had drawn Mr. Stillwood's attention\r\nto the girl by boxing her ears for having, as he passed, slapped his\r\nface with a convenient sprat. Stillwood, acting on the impulse of the\r\nmoment, had taken the child by the hand and dragged her, unwilling,\r\nto her father's place of business--a small coal shed in the Horseferry\r\nRoad. The arrangement he there made amounted practically to the purchase\r\nof the child. She was sent abroad to school and the coal shed closed.\r\nOn her return, ten years later, a big, handsome young woman, he married\r\nher, and learned at leisure the truth of the old saying, “what's bred in\r\nthe bone will come out in the flesh,” scrub it and paint it and hide it\r\naway under fine clothes as you will.\r\n\r\nHer constant complaint against her husband was that he was only a\r\nsolicitor, a profession she considered vulgar; and nothing “riled” old\r\nGadley more than hearing her views upon this point.\r\n\r\n“It's not fair to the gals,” I once heard her say to him. I was working\r\nin the next room, with the door not quite closed, added to which she\r\ntalked at the top of her voice on all subjects. “What real gentleman, I\r\nshould like to know, is going to marry the daughter of a City attorney?\r\nAs I told him years ago, he ought to have retired and gone into the\r\nHouse.”\r\n\r\n“The very thing your poor father used to talk of doing whenever things\r\nwere going a bit queer in the retail coal and potato business,” grunted\r\nold Gadley.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stillwood called him a “low beast” in her most aristocratic tones,\r\nand swept out of the room.\r\n\r\nNot that old Stillwood himself ever expressed fondness for the law.\r\n\r\n“I am not at all sure, Kelver,” I remember his saying to me on one\r\noccasion, “that you have done wisely in choosing the law. It makes\r\none regard humanity morally as the medical profession regards it\r\nphysically:--as universally unsound. You suspect everybody of being a\r\nrogue. When people are behaving themselves, we lawyers hear nothing of\r\nthem. All we hear of is roguery, trickery and hypocrisy. It\r\ndeteriorates the character, Kelver. We live in a perpetual atmosphere of\r\ntransgression. I sometimes fancy it may be infectious.”\r\n\r\n“It does not seem to have infected you, sir,” I replied; for, as I think\r\nI have already mentioned, the firm of Stillwood, Waterhead and Royal\r\nwas held in legal circles as the synonym for rectitude of dealing quite\r\nold-fashioned.\r\n\r\n“I hope not, Kelver, I hope not,” the old gentleman replied; “and yet,\r\ndo you know, I sometimes suspect myself--wonder if I may not perhaps\r\nbe a scamp without realising it. A rogue, you know, Kelver, can always\r\nexplain himself into an honest man to his own satisfaction. A scamp is\r\nnever a scamp to himself.”\r\n\r\nHis words for the moment alarmed me, for, acting on old Gadley's\r\nadvice, I had persuaded my mother to put all her small capital into Mr.\r\nStillwood's hands for re-investment, a transaction that had resulted in\r\nsubstantial increase of our small income. But, looking into his smiling\r\neyes, my momentary fear vanished.\r\n\r\nLaughing, he laid his hand upon my shoulder. “One person always be\r\nsuspicious of, Kelver--yourself. Nobody can do you so much harm as\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\nOf Washburn we saw more and more. “Hal” we both called him now, for\r\nremoving with his gentle, masterful hands my mother's shyness from about\r\nher, he had established himself almost as one of the family, my mother\r\nregarding him as she might some absurdly bearded boy entrusted to her\r\ncare without his knowing it, I looking up to him as to some wonderful\r\nelder brother.\r\n\r\n“You rest me, Mrs. Kelver,” he would say, lighting his pipe and sinking\r\ndown into the deep leathern chair that always waited for him in our\r\nparlour. “Your even voice, your soft eyes, your quiet hands, they soothe\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“It is good for a man,” he would say, looking from one to the other of\r\nus through the hanging smoke, “to test his wisdom by two things:\r\nthe face of a good woman, and the ear of a child--I beg your pardon,\r\nPaul--of a young man. A good woman's face is the white sunlight. Under\r\nthe gas-lamps who shall tell diamond from paste? Bring it into the\r\nsunlight: does it stand that test? Then it is good. And the children!\r\nthey are the waiting earth on which we fling our store. Is it chaff and\r\ndust or living seed? Wait and watch. I shower my thoughts over our Paul,\r\nMrs. Kelver. They seem to me brilliant, deep, original. The young beggar\r\nswallows them, forgets them. They were rubbish. Then I say something\r\nthat dwells with him, that grows. Ah, that was alive, that was a seed.\r\nThe waiting earth, it can make use only of what is true.”\r\n\r\n“You should marry, Hal,” my mother would say. It was her panacea for all\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n“I would, Mrs. Kelver,” he answered her on one occasion, “I would\r\nto-morrow if I could marry half a dozen women. I should make an ideal\r\nhusband for half a dozen wives. One I should neglect for five days, and\r\nbe a burden to upon the sixth.”\r\n\r\nFrom any other than Hal my mother would have taken such a remark, made\r\neven in jest, as an insult to her sex. But Hal's smile was a coating\r\nthat could sugar any pill.\r\n\r\n“I am not one man, Mrs. Kelver, I am half a dozen. If I were to marry\r\none wife she would be married to six husbands. It is too many for any\r\nwoman to manage.”\r\n\r\n“Have you never fallen in love?” asked my mother.\r\n\r\n“Three of me have, but on each occasion the other five of me out-voted\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“You're sure six would be sufficient?” queried my mother, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Just the right number, Mrs. Kelver. There is one of me must worship,\r\nadore a woman madly, abjectly; grovel before her like the Troubadour\r\nbefore his Queen of Song, eat her slipper, drink the water she has\r\nwashed in, scourge himself before her window, die for a kiss of her\r\nglove flung down with a laugh. She must be scornful, contemptuous,\r\ncruel. There is another I would cherish, a tender, yielding creature,\r\none whose face would light at my coming, cloud at my going; one to whom\r\nI should be a god. There is a third I, a child of Pan--an ugly little\r\nbeast, Mrs. Kelver; horns on head and hoofs on feet, leering through the\r\nwood, seeking its fit mate. And a fourth would wed a wholesome, homely\r\nwench, deep of bosom, broad of hip; fit mother of a sturdy brood. A\r\nfifth could only be content with a true friend, a comrade wise and\r\nwitty, a sharer and understander of all joys and thoughts and feelings.\r\nAnd a last, Mrs. Kelver, yearns for a woman pure and sweet, clothed in\r\nlove and crowned with holiness. Shouldn't we be a handful, Mrs. Kelver,\r\nfor any one woman in an eight-roomed house?”\r\n\r\nBut my mother was not to be discouraged. “You will find the woman one\r\nday, Hal, who will be all of them to you--all of them that are worth\r\nhaving, that is. And your eight-roomed house will be a kingdom!”\r\n\r\n“A man is many, and a woman but one,” answered Hal.\r\n\r\n“That is what men say who are too blind to see more than one side of a\r\nwoman,” retorted my mother, a little sharply", "ed house?”\r\n\r\nBut my mother was not to be discouraged. “You will find the woman one\r\nday, Hal, who will be all of them to you--all of them that are worth\r\nhaving, that is. And your eight-roomed house will be a kingdom!”\r\n\r\n“A man is many, and a woman but one,” answered Hal.\r\n\r\n“That is what men say who are too blind to see more than one side of a\r\nwoman,” retorted my mother, a little sharply; for the honour and credit\r\nof her own sex in all things was very dear to my mother. And indeed this\r\nI have learned, that the flag of Womanhood you shall ever find upheld by\r\nall true women, flouted only by the false. For a judge in petticoats is\r\never but a witness in a wig.\r\n\r\nHal laid aside his pipe and leant forward in his chair. “Now tell us,\r\nMrs. Kelver, for our guidance, we two young bachelors, what must the\r\nlover of a young girl be?”\r\n\r\nAlways very serious on this subject of love, my mother answered gravely:\r\n“She asks for the whole of a man, Hal, not merely for a sixth, nor any\r\nother part of him. She is a child asking for a lover to whom she can\r\nlook up, who will teach her, guide her, protect her. She is a queen\r\ndemanding homage, and yet he is her king whom it is her joy to serve.\r\nShe asks to be his partner, his fellow-worker, his playmate, and at the\r\nsame time she loves to think of him as her child, her big baby she must\r\ntake care of. Whatever he has to give she has also to respond with. You\r\nneed not marry six wives, Hal; you will find your six in one.\r\n\r\n“'As the water to the vessel, woman shapes herself to man;' an old\r\nheathen said that three thousand years ago, and others have repeated\r\nhim; that is what you mean.”\r\n\r\n“I don't like that way of putting it,” answered my mother. “I mean that\r\nas you say of man, so in every true woman is contained all women. But to\r\nknow her completely you must love her with all love.”\r\n\r\nSometimes the talk would be of religion, for my mother's faith was\r\nno dead thing that must be kept ever sheltered from the air, lest it\r\ncrumble.\r\n\r\nOne evening “Who are we that we should live?” cried Hal. “The spider\r\nis less cruel; the very pig less greedy, gluttonous and foul; the tiger\r\nless tigerish; our cousin ape less monkeyish. What are we but savages,\r\nclothed and ashamed, nine-tenths of us?”\r\n\r\n“But Sodom and Gomorrah,” reminded him my mother, “would have been\r\nspared for the sake of ten just men.”\r\n\r\n“Much more sensible to have hurried the ten men out, leaving the\r\nremainder to be buried with all their abominations under their own\r\nashes,” growled Hal.\r\n\r\n“And we shall be purified,” continued my mother, “the evil in us washed\r\naway.”\r\n\r\n“Why have made us ill merely to mend us? If the Almighty were so anxious\r\nfor our company, why not have made us decent in the beginning?” He had\r\njust come away from a meeting of Poor Law Guardians, and was in a state\r\nof dissatisfaction with human nature generally.\r\n\r\n“It is His way,” answered my mother. “The precious stone lies hid in\r\nclay. He has His purpose.”\r\n\r\n“Is the stone so very precious?”\r\n\r\n“Would He have taken so much pains to fashion it if it were not? You see\r\nit all around you, Hal, in your daily practice--heroism, self-sacrifice,\r\nlove stronger than death. Can you think He will waste it, He who uses\r\nagain even the dead leaf?”\r\n\r\n“Shall the new leaf remember the new flower?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if it ever knew it. Shall memory be the only thing to die?”\r\n\r\nOften of an evening I would accompany Hal upon his rounds. By the savage\r\ntribe he both served and ruled he had come to be regarded as medicine\r\nman and priest combined. He was both their tyrant and their slave,\r\nworking for them early and late, yet bullying them unmercifully,\r\nenforcing his commands sometimes with vehement tongue, and where that\r\nwould not suffice with quick fists; the counsellor, helper, ruler,\r\nliterally of thousands. Of income he could have made barely enough to\r\nlive upon; but few men could have enjoyed more sense of power; and that\r\nI think it was that held him to the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n“Nature laid me by and forgot me for a couple of thousand years,” was\r\nhis own explanation of himself. “Born in my proper period, I should have\r\nclimbed to chieftainship upon uplifted shields. I might have been an\r\nAttila, an Alaric. Among the civilised one can only climb by crawling,\r\nand I am too impatient to crawl. Here I am king at once by force of\r\nbrain and muscle.” So in Poplar he remained, poor in fees but rich in\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nThe love of justice was a passion with him. The oppressors of the poor\r\nknew and feared him well. Injustice once proved before him, vengeance\r\nfollowed sure. If the law would not help, he never hesitated to employ\r\nlawlessness, of which he could always command a satisfactory supply.\r\nBumble might have the Board of Guardians at his back, Shylock legal\r\nsupport for his pound of flesh; but sooner or later the dark night\r\nbrought punishment, a ducking in dock basin or canal, “Brutal Assault\r\nUpon a Respected Resident” (according to the local papers), the\r\n“miscreants” always making and keeping good their escape, for he was an\r\nadmirable organiser.\r\n\r\nOne night it seemed to him necessary that a child should go at once into\r\nthe Infirmary.\r\n\r\n“It ain't no use my taking her now,” explained the mother, “I'll only\r\nget bullyragged for disturbing 'em. My old man was carried there three\r\nmonths ago when he broke his leg, but they wouldn't take him in till the\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\n“Oho! oho! oho!” sang Hal, taking the child up in his arms and putting\r\non his hat. “You follow me; we'll have some sport. Tally ho! tally\r\nho!” And away we went, Hal heading our procession through the streets,\r\nshouting a rollicking song, the baby staring at him openmouthed.\r\n\r\n“Now ring,” cried Hal to the mother on our reaching the Workhouse gate.\r\n“Ring modestly, as becomes the poor ringing at the gate of Charity.” And\r\nthe bell tinkled faintly.\r\n\r\n“Ring again!” cried Hal, drawing back into the shadow; and at last the\r\nwicket opened.\r\n\r\n“Oh, if you please, sir, my baby--”\r\n\r\n“Blast your baby!” answered a husky voice, “what d'ye mean by coming\r\nhere this time of night?”\r\n\r\n“Please, sir, I'm afraid it's dying, and the Doctor--”\r\n\r\nThe man was no sentimentalist, and to do him justice made no\r\nhypocritical pretence of being one. He consigned the baby and its mother\r\nand the doctor to Hell, and the wicket would have closed but for the\r\npoint of Hal's stick.\r\n\r\n“Open the gate!” roared Hal. It was idle pretending not to hear Hal\r\nanywhere within half a mile of him when he filled his lungs for a cry.\r\n“Open it quick, you blackguard! You gross vat-load of potato spirit,\r\nyou--”\r\n\r\nThat the Governor should speak a language familiar to the governed was\r\nheld by the Romans, born rulers of men, essential to authority. This\r\ntheory Hal also maintained. His command of idiom understanded by his\r\npeople was one of his rods of power. In less time than it took the\r\ntrembling porter to loosen the bolts, Hal had presented him with a\r\nword picture of himself, as seen by others, that must have lessened his\r\nself-esteem.\r\n\r\n“I didn't know as it was you, Doctor,” explained the man.\r\n\r\n“No, you thought you had only to deal with some helpless creature you\r\ncould bully. Stir your fat carcass, you ugly cur! I'm in a hurry.”\r\n\r\nThe House Surgeon was away, but an attendant or two were lounging about,\r\n", " porter to loosen the bolts, Hal had presented him with a\r\nword picture of himself, as seen by others, that must have lessened his\r\nself-esteem.\r\n\r\n“I didn't know as it was you, Doctor,” explained the man.\r\n\r\n“No, you thought you had only to deal with some helpless creature you\r\ncould bully. Stir your fat carcass, you ugly cur! I'm in a hurry.”\r\n\r\nThe House Surgeon was away, but an attendant or two were lounging about,\r\nunfortunately for themselves, for Hal, being there, took it upon himself\r\nto go round the ward setting crooked things straight; and a busy and\r\nalarming time they had of it. Not till a couple of hours later did he\r\nfling himself forth again, having enjoyed himself greatly.\r\n\r\nA gentleman came to reside in the district, a firm believer in the\r\nwisdom of the couplet: “A woman, a spaniel and a walnut tree, The more\r\nyou beat them the better they be.” The spaniel and the walnut tree he\r\ndid not possess, so his wife had the benefit of his undivided energies.\r\nWhether his treatment had improved her morally, one cannot say; her\r\nevident desire to do her best may have been natural or may have been\r\nassisted; but physically it was injuring her. He used to beat her about\r\nthe head with his strap, his argument being that she always seemed half\r\nasleep, and that this, for the time being, woke her up. Sympathisers\r\nbrought complaint to Hal, for the police in that neighbourhood are to\r\nkeep the streets respectable. With the life in the little cells that\r\nline them they are no more concerned than are the scavengers of the\r\nsewers with the domestic arrangements of the rats.\r\n\r\n“What's he like?” asked Hal.\r\n\r\n“He's a big 'un,” answered the woman who had come with the tale, “and\r\nhe's good with his fists--I've seen him. But there's no getting at him.\r\nHe's the sort to have the law on you if you interfere with him, and\r\nshe's the sort to help him.”\r\n\r\n“Any likely time to catch him at it?” asked Hal.\r\n\r\n“Saturdays it's as regular as early closing,” answered the woman, “but\r\nyou might have to wait a bit.”\r\n\r\n“I'll wait in your room, granny, next Saturday,” suggested Hal.\r\n\r\n“All right,” agreed the woman, “I'll risk it, even if I do get a bloody\r\nhead for it.”\r\n\r\nSo that week end we sat very still on two rickety chairs listening to a\r\nlong succession of sharp, cracking sounds that, had one not known,\r\none might have imagined produced by some child monotonously exploding\r\npercussion caps, each one followed by an answering groan. Hal never\r\nmoved, but sat smoking his pipe, an ugly smile about his mouth. Only\r\nonce he opened his lips, and then it was to murmur to himself: “And God\r\nblessed them and said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply.”\r\n\r\nThe horror ceased at last, and later we heard the door unlock and a\r\nman's foot upon the landing above. Hal beckoned to me, and swiftly we\r\nslipped out and down the creaking stairs. He opened the front door, and\r\nwe waited in the evil-smelling little passage. The man came towards\r\nus whistling. He was a powerfully built fellow, rather good-looking,\r\nI remember. He stopped abruptly upon catching sight of Hal, who stood\r\ncrouching in the shadow of the door.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing here?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Waiting to pull your nose!” answered Hal, suiting the action to the\r\nword. And then laughing he ran down the street, I following.\r\n\r\nThe man gave chase, calling to us with a string of imprecations to stop.\r\nBut Hal only ran the faster, though after a street or two he slackened,\r\nand the man gained on us a little.\r\n\r\nSo we continued, the distance between us and our pursuer now a little\r\nmore, now a little less. People turned and stared at us. A few boys,\r\nscenting grim fun, followed shouting for awhile; but these we soon\r\nout-paced, till at last in deserted streets, winding among warehouses\r\nbordering the river, we three ran alone, between long, lifeless walls. I\r\nlooked into Hal's face from time to time, and he was laughing; but every\r\nnow and then he would look over his shoulder at the man behind him still\r\nfollowing doggedly, and then his face would be twisted into a comically\r\nterrified grimace. Turning into a narrow cul-de-sac, Hal suddenly ducked\r\nbehind a wide brick buttress, and the man, still running, passed us.\r\nAnd then Hal stood up and called to him, and the man turned, looked into\r\nHal's eyes, and understood.\r\n\r\nHe was not a coward. Besides, even a rat when cornered will fight for\r\nits life. He made a rush at Hal, and Hal made no attempt to defend\r\nhimself. He stood there laughing, and the man struck him full in the\r\nface, and the blood spurted out and flowed down into his mouth. The\r\nman came on again, though terror was in every line of his face, all his\r\ndesire being to escape. But this time Hal drove him back again. They\r\nfought for awhile, if one can call it fighting, till the man, mad for\r\nair, reeled against the wall, stood there quivering convulsively, his\r\nmouth wide open, resembling more than anything else some huge dying\r\nfish. And Hal drew away and waited.\r\n\r\nI have no desire to see again the sight I saw that quiet, still evening,\r\nframed by those high, windowless walls, from behind which sounded with\r\nceaseless regularity the gentle swish of the incoming tide. All sense of\r\nretribution was drowned in the sight of Hal's evident enjoyment of his\r\nsport. The judge had disappeared, leaving the work to be accomplished by\r\na savage animal loosened for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe wretched creature flung itself again towards its only door of\r\nescape, fought with the vehemence of despair, to be flung back again, a\r\nhideous, bleeding mass of broken flesh. I tried to cling to Hal's arm,\r\nbut one jerk of his steel muscles flung me ten feet away.\r\n\r\n“Keep off, you fool!” he cried. “I won't kill him. I'm keeping my head.\r\nI shall know when to stop.” And I crept away and waited.\r\n\r\nHal joined me a little later, wiping the blood from his face. We made\r\nour way to a small public-house near the river, and from there Hal sent\r\na couple of men on whom he could rely with instructions how to act. I\r\nnever heard any more of the matter. It was a subject on which I did not\r\ncare to speak to Hal. I can only hope that good came of it.\r\n\r\nThere was a spot--it has been cleared away since to make room for the\r\napproach to Greenwich Tunnel--it was then the entrance to a grain depot\r\nin connection with the Milwall Docks. A curious brick well it resembled,\r\nin the centre of which a roadway wound downward, corkscrew fashion,\r\ndisappearing at the bottom into darkness under a yawning arch. The place\r\npossessed the curious property of being ever filled with a ceaseless\r\nmurmur, as though it were some aerial maelstrom, drawing into its\r\nsilent vacuum all wandering waves of sound from the restless human ocean\r\nflowing round it. No single tone could one ever distinguish: it was\r\na mingling of all voices, heard there like the murmur of a sea-soaked\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nWe passed through it on our return. Its work for the day was finished,\r\nits strange, weary song uninterrupted by the mighty waggons thundering\r\nup and down its spiral way. Hal paused, leaning against the railings\r\nthat encircled its centre, and listened.\r\n\r\n“Hark, do you not hear it, Paul?” he asked. “It is the music of\r\nHumanity. All human notes are needful to its making: the faint wail of\r\nthe new-born, the cry of the dying thief; the beating of the hammers,\r\nthe merry trip of dancers; the clatter of the teacups, the roaring of\r\nthe streets; the crooning of the mother to her babe, the scream of the\r\ntortured child; the meeting kiss of lovers", " not hear it, Paul?” he asked. “It is the music of\r\nHumanity. All human notes are needful to its making: the faint wail of\r\nthe new-born, the cry of the dying thief; the beating of the hammers,\r\nthe merry trip of dancers; the clatter of the teacups, the roaring of\r\nthe streets; the crooning of the mother to her babe, the scream of the\r\ntortured child; the meeting kiss of lovers, the sob of those that part.\r\nListen! prayers and curses, sighs and laughter; the soft breathing of\r\nthe sleeping, the fretful feet of pain; voices of pity, voices of hate;\r\nthe glad song of the strong, the foolish complaining of the weak. Listen\r\nto it, Paul! Right and wrong, good and evil, hope and despair, it is but\r\none voice--a single note, drawn by the sweep of the Player's hand across\r\nthe quivering strings of man. What is the meaning of it, Paul? Can you\r\nread it? Sometimes it seems to me a note of joy, so full, so endless,\r\nso complete, that I cry: 'Blessed be the Lord whose hammers have beaten\r\nupon us, whose fires have shaped us to His ends!' And sometimes it\r\nsounds to me a dying note, so that I could curse Him who in wantonness\r\nhas wrung it from the anguish of His creatures--till I would that\r\nI could fling myself, Prometheus like, between Him and His victims,\r\ncalling: 'My darkness, but their light; my agony, O God; their hope!'”\r\n\r\nThe faint light from a neighbouring gas-lamp fell upon his face that\r\nan hour before I had seen the face of a wild beast. The ugly mouth was\r\nquivering, tears stood in his great, tender eyes. Could his prayer in\r\nthat moment have been granted, could he have pressed against his bosom\r\nall the pain of the world, he would have rejoiced.\r\n\r\nHe shook himself together with a laugh. “Come, Paul, we have had a busy\r\nafternoon, and I'm thirsty. Let us drink some beer, my boy, good sound\r\nbeer, and plenty of it.”\r\n\r\nMy mother fell ill that winter. Mountain born and mountain bred, the\r\nclose streets had never agreed with her, and scolded by all of us, she\r\npromised, “come the fine weather,” to put sentiment behind her, and go\r\naway from them.\r\n\r\n“I'm thinking she will,” said Hal, gripping my shoulder with his strong\r\nhand, “but it'll be by herself that she'll go, lad. My wonder is,” he\r\ncontinued, “that she has held out so long. If anything, it is you that\r\nhave kept her alive. Now that you are off her mind to a certain extent,\r\nshe is worrying about your father, I expect. These women, they never\r\nwill believe a man can take care of himself, even in Heaven. She's never\r\nquite trusted the Lord with him, and never will till she's there to give\r\nan eye to things herself.”\r\n\r\nHal's prophecy fell true. She left “come the fine weather,” as she had\r\npromised: I remember it was the first day primroses were hawked in the\r\nstreet. But another death had occurred just before; which, concerning me\r\nclosely as it does, I had better here dispose of; and that was the death\r\nof old Mr. Stillwood, who passed away rich in honour and regret, and was\r\nburied with much ostentation and much sincere sorrow; for he had been to\r\nmany of his clients, mostly old folk, rather a friend than a mere man\r\nof business, and had gained from all with whom he had come in contact,\r\nrespect, and from many real affection.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the old legal fashions that in his life he had so\r\nfondly clung to, his will was read aloud by Mr. Gadley after the return\r\nfrom the funeral, and many were the tears its recital called forth.\r\nWritten years ago by himself and never altered, its quaint phraseology\r\nwas full of kindly thought and expression. No one had been forgotten.\r\nClerks, servants, poor relations, all had been treated with even-handed\r\njustice, while for those with claim upon him, ample provision had\r\nbeen made. Few wills, I think, could ever have been read less open to\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nOld Gadley slipped his arm into mine as we left the house. “If you've\r\nnothing to do, young 'un,” he said, “I'll get you to come with me to the\r\noffice. I have got all the keys in my pocket, and we shall be quiet.\r\nIt will be sad work for me, and I had rather we were alone. A couple of\r\nhours will show us everything.”\r\n\r\nWe lighted the wax candles--old Stillwood could never tolerate gas in\r\nhis own room--and opening the safe took out the heavy ledgers one by\r\none, and from them Gadley dictated figures which I wrote down and added\r\nup.\r\n\r\n“Thirty years I have kept these books for him,” said old Gadley, as we\r\nlaid by the last of them, “thirty years come Christmas next, he and I\r\ntogether. No other hands but ours have ever touched them, and now people\r\nto whom they mean nothing but so much business will fling them about,\r\ndrop greasy crumbs upon them--I know their ways, the brutes!--scribble\r\nall over them. And he who always would have everything so neat and\r\norderly!”\r\n\r\nWe came to the end of them in less than the time old Gadley had thought\r\nneedful: in such perfect order had everything been maintained. I was\r\npreparing to go, but old Gadley had drawn a couple of small keys from\r\nhis pocket, and was shuffling again towards the safe.\r\n\r\n“Only one more,” he explained in answer to my look, “his own private\r\nledger. It will merely be in the nature of a summary, but we'll just\r\nglance through it.”\r\n\r\nHe opened an inner drawer and took from it a small thick volume bound\r\nin green leather and closed with two brass locks. An ancient volume, it\r\nappeared, its strong binding faded and stained. Old Gadley sat down\r\nwith it at the dead man's own desk, and snuffing the two shaded candles,\r\nunlocked and opened it. I was standing opposite, so that the book to me\r\nwas upside down, but the date on the first page, “1841,” caught my eye,\r\nas also the small neat writing now brown with age.\r\n\r\n“So neat, so orderly he always was,” murmured old Gadley again,\r\nsmoothing the page affectionately with his hand, and I waited for his\r\ndictation.\r\n\r\nBut no glib flow of figures fell from him. His eyebrows suddenly\r\ncontracted, his body stiffened itself. Then for the next quarter of an\r\nhour nothing sounded in the quiet room but his turning of the creakling\r\npages. Once or twice he glanced round swiftly over his shoulder, as\r\nthough haunted by the idea of some one behind him; then back to the\r\nneat, closely written folios, his little eyes, now exhibiting a comical\r\nlook of horror, starting out of his round red face. First slowly, then\r\nquickly with trembling hands he turned the pages, till the continual\r\nratling of the leaves sounded like strange, mocking laughter through\r\nthe silent, empty room; almost one could imagine it coming from some\r\nwatching creature hidden in the shadows.\r\n\r\nThe end reached, he sat staring before him, his whole body quivering,\r\ngreat beads of sweat upon his shiny bald head.\r\n\r\n“Am I mad?” was all he could find to say. “Kelver, am I mad?”\r\n\r\nHe handed me the book. It was a cynically truthful record of fraud,\r\nextending over thirty years. Every client, every friend, every relative\r\nthat had fallen into his net he had robbed: the fortunate ones of a\r\npart, the majority of their all. Its very first entry debited him\r\nwith the proceeds of his own partner's estate. Its last ran--“Re\r\nKelver--various sales of stock.” To his credit were his payments year\r\nafter year of imaginary interests on imaginary securities, the surplus\r\naccounted for with simple brevity: “Transferred to own account.” No\r\nrecord could have been more clear, more frank. Beneath each transaction\r\nwas written its true history", "part, the majority of their all. Its very first entry debited him\r\nwith the proceeds of his own partner's estate. Its last ran--“Re\r\nKelver--various sales of stock.” To his credit were his payments year\r\nafter year of imaginary interests on imaginary securities, the surplus\r\naccounted for with simple brevity: “Transferred to own account.” No\r\nrecord could have been more clear, more frank. Beneath each transaction\r\nwas written its true history; the actual investments, sometimes\r\nnecessary, carefully distinguished from the false. In neat red ink would\r\noccur here and there a note for his own guidance: “Eldest child comes of\r\nage August, '73. Be prepared for trustees desiring production.” Turning\r\nto “August, '73,” one found that genuine investment had been made, to\r\nbe sold again a few months later on. From beginning to end not a single\r\nfalse step had he committed. Suspicious clients had been ear-marked:\r\nthe trusting discriminated with gratitude, and milked again and again to\r\nmeet emergency.\r\n\r\nAs a piece of organisation it was magnificent. No one but a financial\r\ngenius could have picked a dozen steps through such a network of\r\nchicanery. For half a lifetime he had moved among it, dignified,\r\nrespected and secure.\r\n\r\nWhether even he could have maintained his position for another month was\r\ndoubtful. Suicide, though hinted at, was proved to have been impossible.\r\nIt seemed as though with his amazing audacity he had tricked even Death\r\ninto becoming his accomplice.\r\n\r\n“But it is impossible, Kelver!” cried Gadley, “this must be some dream.\r\nStillwood, Waterhead and Royal! What is the meaning of it?”\r\n\r\nHe took the book into his hands again, then burst into tears. “You never\r\nknew him,” wailed the poor little man. “Stillwood, Waterhead and Royal!\r\nI came here as office boy fifty years ago. He was more like a friend to\r\nme than--” and again the sobs shook his little fat body.\r\n\r\nI locked the books away and put him into his hat and coat. But I had\r\nmuch difficulty in getting him out of the office.\r\n\r\n“I daren't, young 'un,” he cried, drawing back. “Fifty years I have\r\nwalked out of this office, proud of it, proud of being connected with\r\nit. I daren't face the street!”\r\n\r\nAll the way home his only idea was: Could it not be hidden? Honest,\r\nkindly little man that he was, he seemed to have no thought for the\r\nunfortunate victims. The good name of his master, of his friend, gone!\r\nStillwood, Waterhead and Royal, a by-word! To have avoided that I\r\nbelieve he would have been willing for yet another hundred clients to be\r\nruined.\r\n\r\nI saw him to his door, then turned homeward; and to my surprise in\r\na dark by-street heard myself laughing heartily. I checked myself\r\ninstantly, feeling ashamed of my callousness, of my seeming indifference\r\nto the trouble even of myself and my mother. Yet as there passed before\r\nme the remembrance of that imposing and expensive funeral with its\r\nmournful following of tearful faces; the hushed reading of the will with\r\nits accompaniment of rustling approval; the picture of the admirably\r\nsympathetic clergyman consoling with white hands Mrs. Stillwood,\r\ninclined to hysteria, but anxious concerning her two hundred pounds'\r\nworth of crape which by no possibility of means could now be paid\r\nfor--recurred to me the obituary notice in “The Chelsea Weekly\r\nChronicle”: the humour of the thing swept all else before it, and I\r\nlaughed again--I could not help it--loud and long. It was my first\r\nintroduction to the comedy of life, which is apt to be more brutal than\r\nthe comedy of fiction.\r\n\r\nBut nearing home, the serious side of the matter forced itself\r\nuppermost. Fortunately, our supposed dividends had been paid to us\r\nby Mr. Stillwood only the month before. Could I keep the thing from\r\ntroubling my mother's last days? It would be hard work. I should have to\r\ndo it alone, for a perhaps foolish pride prevented my taking Hal into my\r\nconfidence, even made his friendship a dread to me, lest he should come\r\nto learn and offer help. There is a higher generosity, it is said, that\r\ncan receive with pleasure as well as bestow favour; but I have never\r\nfelt it. Could I be sure of acting my part, of not betraying myself to\r\nher sharp eyes, of keeping newspapers and chance gossip away from her?\r\nGood shrewd Amy I cautioned, but I shrank from even speaking on the\r\nsubject to Hal, and my fear was lest he should blunder into the subject,\r\nwhich for the usual nine days occupied much public attention. But\r\nfortunately he appeared not even to have heard of the scandal.\r\n\r\nPossibly had the need lasted longer I might have failed, but as it was,\r\na few weeks saw the end.\r\n\r\n“Don't leave me to-day, Paul,” whispered my mother to me one morning. So\r\nI stayed, and in the evening my mother put her arms around my neck and I\r\nlay beside her, my head upon her breast, as I used to when a little boy.\r\nAnd when the morning came I was alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nDESCRIBES THE DESERT ISLAND TO WHICH PAUL WAS DRIFTED.\r\n\r\n“Room to let for a single gentleman.” Sometimes in an idle hour,\r\nimpelled by foolishness, I will knock at the door. It is opened after a\r\nlonger or shorter interval by the “slavey”--in the morning, slatternly,\r\nher arms concealed beneath her apron; in the afternoon, smart in dirty\r\ncap and apron. How well I know her! Unchanged, not grown an inch--her\r\nround bewildered eyes, her open mouth, her touzled hair, her scored red\r\nhands. With an effort I refrain from muttering: “So sorry, forgot\r\nmy key,” from pushing past her and mounting two at a time the narrow\r\nstairs, carpeted to the first floor, but bare beyond. Instead, I say,\r\n“Oh, what rooms have you to let?” when, scuttling to the top of the\r\nkitchen stairs, she will call over the banisters: “A gentleman to see\r\nthe rooms.” There comes up, panting, a harassed-looking, elderly\r\nfemale, but genteel in black. She crushes past the little “slavey,” and\r\napproaching, eyes me critically.\r\n\r\n“I have a very nice room on the first floor,” she informs me, “and one\r\nbehind on the third.”\r\n\r\nI agree to see them, explaining that I am seeking them for a young\r\nfriend of mine. We squeeze past the hat and umbrella stand: there is\r\njust room, but one must keep close to the wall. The first floor is\r\nrather an imposing apartment, with a marble-topped sideboard measuring\r\nquite three feet by two, the doors of which will remain closed if you\r\nintroduce a wad of paper between them. A green table-cloth, matching the\r\ncurtains, covers the loo-table. The lamp is perfectly safe so long as\r\nit stands in the exact centre of the table, but should not be shifted.\r\nA paper fire-stove ornament in some mysterious way bestows upon the room\r\nan air of chastity. Above the mantelpiece is a fly-blown mirror, between\r\nthe once gilt frame and glass of which can be inserted invitation\r\ncards; indeed, one or two so remain, proving that the tenants even of\r\n“bed-sitting-rooms” are not excluded from social delights. The wall\r\nopposite is adorned by an oleograph of the kind Cheap Jacks sell\r\nby auction on Saturday nights in the Pimlico Road, and warrant as\r\n“hand-made.” Generally speaking, it is a Swiss landscape. There appears\r\nto be more “body” in a Swiss landscape than in scenes from less favoured\r\nlocalities. A dilapidated mill, a foaming torrent, a mountain, a maiden\r\nand a cow can at the least be relied upon. An easy chair (I disclaim\r\nall responsibility for the adjective), stuffed with many coils of steel\r\nwire, each possessing a “business end” in admirable working order, and\r\ncovered with horsehair, highly glazed, awaits the uninitiated.", "\r\nto be more “body” in a Swiss landscape than in scenes from less favoured\r\nlocalities. A dilapidated mill, a foaming torrent, a mountain, a maiden\r\nand a cow can at the least be relied upon. An easy chair (I disclaim\r\nall responsibility for the adjective), stuffed with many coils of steel\r\nwire, each possessing a “business end” in admirable working order, and\r\ncovered with horsehair, highly glazed, awaits the uninitiated. There is\r\none way of sitting upon it, and only one: by using the extreme edge, and\r\nplanting your feet firmly on the floor. If you attempt to lean back in\r\nit you inevitably slide out of it. When so treated it seems to say to\r\nyou: “Excuse me, you are very heavy, and you would really be much more\r\ncomfortable upon the floor. Thank you so much.” The bed is behind the\r\ndoor, and the washstand behind the bed. If you sit facing the window you\r\ncan forget the bed. On the other hand, if more than one friend come\r\nto call on you, you are glad of it. As a matter of fact, experienced\r\nvisitors prefer it--make straight for it, refusing with firmness to\r\nexchange it for the easy chair.\r\n\r\n“And this room is?”\r\n\r\n“Eight shillings a week, sir--with attendance, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Any extras?”\r\n\r\n“The lamp, sir, is eighteenpence a week; and the kitchen fire, if the\r\ngentleman wishes to dine at home, two shillings.”\r\n\r\n“And fire?”\r\n\r\n“Sixpence a scuttle, sir, I charge for coals.”\r\n\r\n“It's rather a small scuttle.”\r\n\r\nThe landlady bridles a little. “The usual size, I think, sir.” One\r\npresumes there is a special size in coal-scuttles made exclusively for\r\nlodging-house keepers.\r\n\r\nI agree that while I am about it I may as well see the other room,\r\nthe third floor back. The landlady opens the door for me, but remains\r\nherself on the landing. She is a stout lady, and does not wish to dwarf\r\nthe apartment by comparison. The arrangement here does not allow of your\r\nignoring the bed. It is the life and soul of the room, and it\r\ndeclines to efface itself. Its only possible rival is the washstand,\r\nstraw-coloured; with staring white basin and jug, together with other\r\nappurtenances. It glares defiantly from its corner. “I know I'm small,”\r\n it seems to say; “but I'm very useful; and I won't be ignored.”\r\n The remaining furniture consists of a couple of chairs--there is no\r\nhypocrisy about them: they are not easy and they do not pretend to be\r\neasy; a small chest of light-painted drawers before the window, with\r\nwhite china handles, upon which is a tiny looking-glass; and, occupying\r\nthe entire remaining space, after allowing three square feet for the\r\ntenant, when he arrives, an attenuated four-legged table apparently\r\nhome-made. The only ornament in the room is, suspended above the\r\nfireplace, a funeral card, framed in beer corks. As the corpse\r\nintroduced by the ancient Egyptians into their banquets, it is hung\r\nthere perhaps to remind the occupant of the apartment that the luxuries\r\nand allurements of life have their end; or maybe it consoles him in\r\ndespondent moments with the reflection that after all he might be worse\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThe rent of this room is three-and-sixpence a week, also including\r\nattendance; lamp, as for the first floor, eighteen-pence; but kitchen\r\nfire a shilling.\r\n\r\n“But why should kitchen fire for the first floor be two shillings, and\r\nfor this only one?”\r\n\r\n“Well, as a rule, sir, the first floor wants more cooking done.”\r\n\r\nYou are quite right, my dear lady, I was forgetting. The gentleman\r\nin the third floor back! cooking for him is not a great tax upon the\r\nkitchen fire. His breakfast, it is what, madam, we call plain, I think.\r\nHis lunch he takes out. You may see him, walking round the quiet square,\r\nup and down the narrow street that, leading to nowhere in particular, is\r\nbetween twelve and two somewhat deserted. He carries a paper bag,\r\ninto which at intervals, when he is sure nobody is looking, his mouth\r\ndisappears. From studying the neighbourhood one can guess what it\r\ncontains. Saveloys hereabouts are plentiful and only twopence each.\r\nThere are pie shops, where meat pies are twopence and fruit pies a\r\npenny. The lady behind the counter, using deftly a broad, flat knife,\r\nlifts the little dainty with one twist clean from its tiny dish: it is\r\nmarvellous, having regard to the thinness of the pastry, that she never\r\nbreaks one. Roley-poley pudding, sweet and wonderfully satisfying, more\r\nespecially when cold, is but a penny a slice. Peas pudding, though this\r\nis an awkward thing to eat out of a bag, is comforting upon cold days.\r\nThen with his tea he takes two eggs or a haddock, the fourpenny size;\r\nmaybe on rare occasions, a chop or steak; and you fry it for him, madam,\r\nthough every time he urges on you how much he would prefer it grilled,\r\nfor fried in your one frying-pan its flavour becomes somewhat confused.\r\nBut maybe this is the better for him, for, shutting his eyes and\r\ntrusting only to smell and flavour, he can imagine himself enjoying\r\nvariety. He can begin with herrings, pass on to liver and bacon, opening\r\nhis eyes again for a moment perceive that he has now arrived at the\r\njoint, and closing them again, wind up with distinct suggestion of\r\ntoasted cheese, thus avoiding monotony. For dinner he goes out again.\r\nMaybe he is not hungry, late meals are a mistake; or, maybe, putting\r\nhis hand into his pocket and making calculations beneath a lamp-post,\r\nappetite may come to him. Then there are places cheerful with the sound\r\nof frizzling fat, where fried plaice brown and odorous may be had for\r\nthree halfpence, and a handful of sliced potatoes for a penny; where for\r\nfourpence succulent stewed eels may be discussed; vinegar ad lib.; or\r\nfor sevenpence--but these are red-letter evenings--half a sheep's head\r\nmay be indulged in, which is a supper fit for any king, who happened to\r\nbe hungry.\r\n\r\nI explain that I will discuss the matter with my young friend when he\r\narrives. The landlady says, “Certainly, sir:” she is used to what she\r\ncalls the “wandering Christian;” and easing my conscience by slipping a\r\nshilling into the “slavey's” astonished, lukewarm hand, I pass out\r\nagain into the long, dreary street, now echoing maybe to the sad cry of\r\n“Muffins!”\r\n\r\nOr sometimes of an evening, the lamp lighted, the remnants of the meat\r\ntea cleared away, the flickering firelight cosifying the dingy rooms,\r\nI go a-visiting. There is no need for me to ring the bell, to mount the\r\nstairs. Through the thin transparent walls I can see you plainly,\r\nold friends of mine, fashions a little changed, that is all. We wore\r\nbell-shaped trousers; eight-and-six to measure, seven-and-six if from\r\nstock; fastened our neckties in dashing style with a horseshoe pin. I\r\nthink in the matter of waistcoats we had the advantage of you; ours were\r\ngayer, braver. Our cuffs and collars were of paper: sixpence-halfpenny\r\nthe dozen, three-halfpence the pair. On Sunday they were white and\r\nglistening; on Monday less aggressively obvious; on Tuesday morning\r\ndecidedly dappled. But on Tuesday evening, when with natty cane, or\r\numbrella neatly rolled in patent leather case, we took our promenade\r\ndown Oxford Street--fashionable hour nine to ten p.m.--we could shoot\r\nour arms and cock our chins with the best. Your india-rubber linen has\r\nits advantages. Storm does not wither it; it braves better the heat and\r\nturmoil of the day. The passing of a sponge! and", "ly dappled. But on Tuesday evening, when with natty cane, or\r\numbrella neatly rolled in patent leather case, we took our promenade\r\ndown Oxford Street--fashionable hour nine to ten p.m.--we could shoot\r\nour arms and cock our chins with the best. Your india-rubber linen has\r\nits advantages. Storm does not wither it; it braves better the heat and\r\nturmoil of the day. The passing of a sponge! and your “Dicky” is itself\r\nagain. We had to use bread-crumbs, and so sacrifice the glaze. Yet I\r\ncannot help thinking that for the first few hours, at all events, our\r\npaper was more dazzling.\r\n\r\nFor the rest I see no change in you, old friends. I wave you greeting\r\nfrom the misty street. God rest you, gallant gentlemen, lonely and\r\nfriendless and despised; making the best of joyless lives; keeping\r\nyourselves genteel on twelve, fifteen, or eighteen (ah, but you are\r\nplutocrats!) shillings a week; saving something even of that, maybe, to\r\nhelp the old mother in the country, so proud of her “gentleman” son who\r\nhas book learning and who is “something in the City.” May nothing you\r\ndismay. Bullied, and badgered, and baited from nine to six though you\r\nmay be, from then till bedtime you are rorty young dogs. The half-guinea\r\ntopper, “as worn by the Prince of Wales” (ah, how many a meal has it not\r\ncost!), warmed before the fire, brushed and polished and coaxed, shines\r\nresplendent. The second pair of trousers are drawn from beneath the bed;\r\nin the gaslight, with well-marked crease from top to toe, they will pass\r\nfor new. A pleasant evening to you! May your cheap necktie make all the\r\nimpression your soul can desire! May your penny cigar be mistaken for\r\nHavana! May the barmaid charm your simple heart by addressing you as\r\n“Baby!” May some sweet shop-girl throw a kindly glance at you, inviting\r\nyou to walk with her! May she snigger at your humour; may other dogs\r\ncast envious looks at you, and may no harm come of it!\r\n\r\nYou dreamers of dreams, you who while your companions play and sleep\r\nwill toil upward in the night! You have read Mr. Smiles' “Self-Help,”\r\nLongfellow's “Psalm of Life,” and so strengthened attack with confidence\r\n“French Without a Master,” “Bookkeeping in Six Lessons.” With a sigh to\r\nyourselves you turn aside from the alluring streets, from the bright,\r\nbewitching eyes, into the stuffy air of Birkbeck Institutions,\r\nPolytechnic Schools. May success compensate you for your youth devoid of\r\npleasure! May the partner's chair you seen in visions be yours before\r\nthe end! May you live one day in Clapham in a twelve-roomed house!\r\n\r\nAnd, after all, we have our moments, have we not? The Saturday night at\r\nthe play. The hours of waiting, they are short. We converse with kindred\r\nsouls of the British Drama, its past and future: we have our views. We\r\ndream of Florence This, Kate That; in a little while we shall see\r\nher. Ah, could she but know how we loved her! Her photo is on our\r\nmantelpiece, transforming the dismal little room into a shrine. The poem\r\nwe have so often commenced! when it is finished we will post it to her.\r\nAt least she will acknowledge its receipt; we can kiss the paper her\r\nhand has rested on. The great doors groan, then quiver. Ah, the wild\r\nthrill of that moment! Now push for all you are worth: charge, wriggle,\r\nsquirm! It is an epitome of life. We are through--collarless, panting,\r\npummelled from top to toe: but what of that? Upward, still upward; then\r\ndownward with leaps at risk of our neck, from bench to bench through the\r\ngloom. We have gained the front row! Would we exchange sensations with\r\nthe stallite, strolling languidly to his seat? The extravagant dinner\r\nonce a week! We banquet _a la Francais_, in Soho, for one-and-six,\r\nincluding wine. Does Tortoni ever give his customers a repast they enjoy\r\nmore? I trow not.\r\n\r\nMy first lodging was an attic in a square the other side of Blackfriars\r\nBridge. The rent of the room, if I remember rightly, was three shillings\r\na week with cooking, half-a-crown without. I purchased a methylated\r\nspirit stove with kettle and frying-pan, and took it without.\r\n\r\nOld Hasluck would have helped me willingly, and there were others to\r\nwhom I might have appealed, but a boy's pride held me back. I would make\r\nmy way alone, win my place in the world by myself. To Hal, knowing he\r\nwould sympathise with me, I confided the truth.\r\n\r\n“Had your mother lived,” he told me, “I should have had something to say\r\non the subject. Of course, I knew what had happened, but as it is--well,\r\nyou need not be afraid, I shall not offer you help; indeed, I should\r\nrefuse it were you to ask. Put your Carlyle in your pocket: he is not\r\nall voices, but he is the best maker of men I know. The great thing to\r\nlearn of life is not to be afraid of it.”\r\n\r\n“Look me up now and then,” he added, “and we'll talk about the stars,\r\nthe future of Socialism, and the Woman Question--anything you like\r\nexcept about yourself and your twopenny-half-penny affairs.”\r\n\r\nFrom another it would have sounded brutal, but I understood him. And\r\nso we shook hands and parted for longer than either of us at the time\r\nexpected. The Franco-German War broke out a few weeks later on, and\r\nHal, the love of adventure always strong within him, volunteered his\r\nservices, which were accepted. It was some years before we met again.\r\n\r\nOn the door-post of a house in Farringdon Street, not far from the\r\nCircus, stood in those days a small brass plate, announcing that the\r\n“Ludgate News Rooms” occupied the third and fourth floors, and that the\r\nadmission to the same was one penny. We were a seedy company that every\r\nmorning crowded into these rooms: clerks, shopmen, superior artisans,\r\ntravellers, warehousemen--all of us out of work. Most of us were young,\r\nbut with us was mingled a sprinkling of elder men, and these latter were\r\nalways the saddest and most silent of this little whispering army of\r\nthe down-at-heel. Roughly speaking, we were divided into two groups:\r\nthe newcomers, cheery, confident. These would flit from newspaper to\r\nnewspaper with buzz of pleasant anticipation, select their advertisement\r\nas one choosing some dainty out of a rich and varied menu card, and\r\nreplying to it as one conferring favour.\r\n\r\n“Dear Sir,--in reply to your advertisement in to-day's _Standard_, I\r\nshall be pleased to accept the post vacant in your office. I am of good\r\nappearance and address. I am an excellent--” It was really marvellous\r\nthe quality and number of our attainments. French! we wrote and spoke it\r\nfluently, _a la Ahn_. German! of this we possessed a slighter knowledge,\r\nit was true, but sufficient for mere purposes of commerce. Bookkeeping!\r\narithmetic! geometry! we played with them. The love of work! it was a\r\npassion with us. Our moral character! it would have adorned a Free Kirk\r\nElder. “I could call on you to-morrow or Friday between eleven and one,\r\nor on Saturday any time up till two. Salary required, two guineas a\r\nweek. An early answer will oblige. Yours truly.”\r\n\r\nThe old stagers did not buzz. Hour after hour they sat writing,\r\nsteadily, methodically, with day by day less hope and heavier fears:\r\n\r\n“Sir,--Your advt. in to-day's _D. T._ I am--” of such and such an age.\r\nList of", "orrow or Friday between eleven and one,\r\nor on Saturday any time up till two. Salary required, two guineas a\r\nweek. An early answer will oblige. Yours truly.”\r\n\r\nThe old stagers did not buzz. Hour after hour they sat writing,\r\nsteadily, methodically, with day by day less hope and heavier fears:\r\n\r\n“Sir,--Your advt. in to-day's _D. T._ I am--” of such and such an age.\r\nList of qualifications less lengthy, set forth with more modesty; object\r\ndesired being air of verisimilitude.--“If you decide to engage me I will\r\nendeavour to give you every satisfaction. Any time you like to appoint\r\nI will call on you. I should not ask a high salary to start with. Yours\r\nobediently.”\r\n\r\nDozens of the first letter, hundreds of the second, I wrote with painful\r\ncare, pen carefully chosen, the one-inch margin down the left hand side\r\nof the paper first portioned off with dots. To three or four I received\r\na curt reply, instructing me to call. But the shyness that had stood so\r\nin my way during the earlier half of my school days had now, I know not\r\nwhy, returned upon me, hampering me at every turn. A shy child grown-up\r\nfolks at all events can understand and forgive; but a shy young man\r\nis not unnaturally regarded as a fool. I gave the impression of being\r\nawkward, stupid, sulky. The more I strove against my temperament\r\nthe worse I became. My attempts to be at my ease, to assert myself,\r\nresulted--I could see it myself--only in rudeness.\r\n\r\n“Well, I have got to see one or two others. We will write and let you\r\nknow,” was the conclusion of each interview, and the end, as far as I\r\nwas concerned, of the enterprise.\r\n\r\nMy few pounds, guard them how I would, were dwindling rapidly. Looking\r\nback, it is easy enough to regard one's early struggles from a humorous\r\npoint of view. One knows the story, it all ended happily. But at the\r\ntime there is no means of telling whether one's biography is going to be\r\ncomedy or tragedy. There were moments when I felt confident it was going\r\nto be the latter. Occasionally, when one is feeling well, it is not\r\nunpleasant to contemplate with pathetic sympathy one's own death-bed.\r\nOne thinks of the friends and relations who at last will understand and\r\nregret one, be sorry they had not behaved themselves better. But myself,\r\nthere was no one to regret. I felt very small, very helpless. The world\r\nwas big. I feared it might walk over me, trample me down, never seeing\r\nme. I seemed unable to attract its attention.\r\n\r\nOne morning I found waiting for me at the Reading Room another of the\r\nusual missives. It ran: “Will Mr. P. Kelver call at the above address\r\nto-morrow morning between ten-thirty and eleven.” The paper was headed:\r\n“Lott and Co., Indian Commission Agents, Aldersgate Street.” Without\r\nmuch hope I returned to my lodgings, changed my clothes, donned my\r\nsilk hat, took my one pair of gloves, drew its silk case over my holey\r\numbrella; and so equipped for fight with Fate made my way to Aldersgate\r\nStreet. For a quarter of an hour or so, being too soon, I walked up and\r\ndown the pavement outside the house, gazing at the second-floor windows,\r\nbehind which, so the door-plate had informed me, were the offices of\r\nLott & Co. I could not recall their advertisement, nor my reply to it.\r\nThe firm was evidently not in a very flourishing condition. I wondered\r\nidly what salary they would offer. For a moment I dreamt of a Cheeryble\r\nBrother asking me kindly if I thought I could do with thirty shillings\r\na week as a beginning; but the next I recalled my usual fate, and\r\nconsidered whether it was even worth while to climb the stairs, go\r\nthrough what to me was a painful ordeal, merely to be impressed again\r\nwith the sense of my own worthlessness.\r\n\r\nA fine rain began to fall. I did not wish to unroll my umbrella,\r\nyet felt nervous for my hat. It was five minutes to the half hour.\r\nListlessly I crossed the road and mounted the bare stairs to the second\r\nfloor. Two doors faced me, one marked “Private.” I tapped lightly at the\r\nsecond. Not hearing any response, after a second or two I tapped again.\r\nA sound reached me, but it was unintelligible. I knocked yet again,\r\nstill louder. This time I heard a reply in a shrill, plaintive tone:\r\n\r\n“Oh, do come in.”\r\n\r\nThe tone was one of pathetic entreaty. I turned the handle and entered.\r\nIt was a small room, dimly lighted by a dirty window, the bottom half of\r\nwhich was rendered opaque by tissue paper pasted to its panes. The place\r\nsuggested a village shop rather than an office. Pots of jam, jars of\r\npickles, bottles of wine, biscuit tins, parcels of drapery, boxes of\r\ncandles, bars of soap, boots, packets of stationery, boxes of cigars,\r\ntinned provisions, guns, cartridges--things sufficient to furnish a\r\ndesert island littered every available corner. At a small desk under the\r\nwindow sat a youth with a remarkably small body and a remarkably\r\nlarge head; so disproportionate were the two I should hardly have been\r\nsurprised had he put up his hands and taken it off. Half in the room and\r\nhalf out, I paused.\r\n\r\n“Is this Lott & Co.?” I enquired.\r\n\r\n“No,” he answered; “it's a room.” One eye was fixed upon me, dull and\r\nglassy; it never blinked, it never wavered. With the help of the other\r\nhe continued his writing.\r\n\r\n“I mean,” I explained, coming entirely into the room, “are these the\r\noffices of Lott & Co.?”\r\n\r\n“It's one of them,” he replied; “the back one. If you're really anxious\r\nfor a job, you can shut the door.”\r\n\r\nI complied with his suggestion, and then announced that I was Mr.\r\nKelver--Mr. Paul Kelver.\r\n\r\n“Minikin's my name,” he returned, “Sylvanus Minikin. You don't happen by\r\nany chance to know what you've come for, I suppose?”\r\n\r\nLooking at his body, my inclination was to pick my way among the goods\r\nthat covered the floor and pull his ears for him. From his grave and\r\nmassive face, he might, for all I knew, be the head clerk.\r\n\r\n“I have called to see Mr. Lott,” I replied, with dignity; “I have an\r\nappointment.” I produced the letter from my pocket, and leaning across\r\na sewing-machine, I handed it to him for his inspection. Having read it,\r\nhe suddenly took from its socket the eye with which he had been hitherto\r\nregarding me, and proceeding to polish it upon his pocket handkerchief,\r\nturned upon me his other. Having satisfied himself, he handed me back my\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n“Want my advice?” he asked.\r\n\r\nI thought it might be useful to me, so replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n“Hook it,” was his curt counsel.\r\n\r\n“Why?” I asked. “Isn't he a good employer?”\r\n\r\nReplacing his glass eye, he turned again to his work. “If employment is\r\nwhat you want,” answered Mr. Minikin, “you'll get it. Best employer in\r\nLondon. He'll keep you going for twenty-four hours a day, and then offer\r\nyou overtime at half salary.”\r\n\r\n“I must get something to do,” I confessed.\r\n\r\n“Sit down then,” suggested Mr. Minikin. “Rest while you can.”\r\n\r\nI took the chair; it was the only chair in the room, with the exception\r\nof the one Minikin was sitting on.\r\n\r\n“Apart from his being a bit of a driver,” I asked, “what sort of a man\r\nis he? Is he pleasant?”\r\n\r\n“Never saw him put out but once,” answered Minikin.\r\n\r\nIt sounded well. “When was that?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“All the time I've known him.”\r\n\r\nMy spirits continued to sink. Had I been left alone with Minikin much\r\nlonger, I might have ended", " exception\r\nof the one Minikin was sitting on.\r\n\r\n“Apart from his being a bit of a driver,” I asked, “what sort of a man\r\nis he? Is he pleasant?”\r\n\r\n“Never saw him put out but once,” answered Minikin.\r\n\r\nIt sounded well. “When was that?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“All the time I've known him.”\r\n\r\nMy spirits continued to sink. Had I been left alone with Minikin much\r\nlonger, I might have ended by following his advice, “hooking it” before\r\nMr. Lott arrived. But the next moment I heard the other door open, and\r\nsome one entered the private office. Then the bell rang, and Minikin\r\ndisappeared, leaving the communicating door ajar behind him. The\r\nconversation that I overheard was as follows:\r\n\r\n“Why isn't Mr. Skeat here?”\r\n\r\n“Because he hasn't come.”\r\n\r\n“Where are the letters?”\r\n\r\n“Under your nose.”\r\n\r\n“How dare you answer me like that?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it's the truth. They are under your nose.”\r\n\r\n“Did you give Thorneycroft's man my message?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What did he answer?”\r\n\r\n“Said you were a liar.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he did, did he! What did you reply?”\r\n\r\n“Asked him to tell me something I didn't know.”\r\n\r\n“Thought that clever, didn't you?”\r\n\r\n“Not bad.”\r\n\r\nWhatever faults might be laid to Mr. Lott's door, he at least, I\r\nconcluded, possesssed the virtue of self-control.\r\n\r\n“Anybody been here?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Kelver--Mr. Paul Kelver.”\r\n\r\n“Kelver, Kelver. Who's Kelver?”\r\n\r\n“Know what he is--a fool.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“He's come after the place.”\r\n\r\n“Is he there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What's he like?”\r\n\r\n“Not bad looking; fair--”\r\n\r\n“Idiot! I mean is he smart?”\r\n\r\n“Just at present--got all his Sunday clothes on.”\r\n\r\n“Send him in to me. Don't go, don't go.”\r\n\r\n“How can I send him in to you if I don't go?”\r\n\r\n“Take these. Have you finished those bills of lading?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Good God! when will you have finished them?”\r\n\r\n“Half an hour after I have begun them.”\r\n\r\n“Get out, get out! Has that door been open all the time?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don't suppose it's opened itself.”\r\n\r\nMinikin re-entered with papers in his hand. “In you go,” he said.\r\n“Heaven help you!” And I passed in and closed the door behind me.\r\n\r\nThe room was a replica of the one I had just left. If possible, it was\r\nmore crowded, more packed with miscellaneous articles. I picked my\r\nway through these and approached the desk. Mr. Lott was a small,\r\ndingy-looking man, with very dirty hands, and small, restless eyes. I\r\nwas glad that he was not imposing, or my shyness might have descended\r\nupon me; as it was, I felt better able to do myself justice. At once he\r\nplunged into the business by seizing and waving in front of my eyes a\r\nbulky bundle of letters tied together with red tape.\r\n\r\n“One hundred and seventeen answers to an advertisement,” he cried with\r\nevident satisfaction, “in one day! That shows you the state of the\r\nlabour market!”\r\n\r\nI agreed it was appalling.\r\n\r\n“Poor devils, poor devils!” murmured Mr. Lott “what will become of them?\r\nSome of them will starve. Terrible death, starvation, Kelver; takes such\r\na long time--especially when you're young.”\r\n\r\nHere also I found myself in accord with him.\r\n\r\n“Living with your parents?”\r\n\r\nI explained to him my situation.\r\n\r\n“Any friends?”\r\n\r\nI informed him I was entirely dependent upon my own efforts.\r\n\r\n“Any money? Anything coming in?”\r\n\r\nI told him I had a few pounds still remaining to me, but that after that\r\nwas gone I should be penniless.\r\n\r\n“And to think, Kelver, that there are hundreds, thousands of young\r\nfellows precisely in your position! How sad, how very sad! How long have\r\nyou been looking for a berth?”\r\n\r\n“A month,” I answered him.\r\n\r\n“I thought as much. Do you know why I selected your letter out of the\r\nwhole batch?”\r\n\r\nI replied I hoped it was because he judged from it I should prove\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n“Because it's the worst written of them all.” He pushed it across to me.\r\n“Look at it. Awful, isn't it?”\r\n\r\nI admitted that handwriting was not my strong point.\r\n\r\n“Nor spelling either,” he added, and with truth. “Who do you think will\r\nengage you if I don't?”\r\n\r\n“Nobody,” he continued, without waiting for me to reply. “A month hence\r\nyou will still be looking for a berth, and a month after that. Now, I'm\r\ngoing to do you a good turn; save you from destitution; give you a start\r\nin life.”\r\n\r\nI expressed my gratitude.\r\n\r\nHe waived it aside. “That is my notion of philanthropy: help those that\r\nnobody else will help. That young fellow in the other room--he isn't a\r\nbad worker, he's smart, but he's impertinent.”\r\n\r\nI murmured that I had gathered so much.\r\n\r\n“Doesn't mean to be, can't help it. Noticed his trick of looking at you\r\nwith his glass eye, keeping the other turned away from you?”\r\n\r\nI replied that I had.\r\n\r\n“Always does it. Used to irritate his last employer to madness. Said to\r\nhim one day: 'Do turn that signal lamp of yours off, Minikin, and look\r\nat me with your real eye.' What do you think he answered? That it was\r\nthe only one he'd got, and that he didn't want to expose it to shocks.\r\nWouldn't have mattered so much if it hadn't been one of the ugliest men\r\nin London.”\r\n\r\nI murmured my indignation.\r\n\r\n“I put up with him. Nobody else would. The poor fellow must live.”\r\n\r\nI expressed admiration at Mr. Lott's humanity.\r\n\r\n“You don't mind work? You're not one of those good-for-nothings who\r\nsleep all day and wake up when it's time to go home?”\r\n\r\nI assured him that in whatever else I might fail I could promise him\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n“With some of them,” complained Mr. Lott, in a tone of bitterness, “it's\r\nnothing but play, girls, gadding about the streets. Work, business--oh,\r\nno. I may go bankrupt; my wife and children may go into the workhouse.\r\nNo thought for me, the man that keeps them, feeds them, clothes them.\r\nHow much salary do you want?”\r\n\r\nI hesitated. I gathered this was not a Cheeryble Brother; it would be\r\nnecessary to be moderate in one's demands. “Five-and-twenty shillings a\r\nweek,” I suggested.\r\n\r\nHe repeated the figure in a scream. “Five-and-twenty shillings for\r\nwriting like that! And can't spell commission! Don't know anything about\r\nthe business. Five-and-twenty!--Tell you what I'll do: I'll give you\r\ntwelve.”\r\n\r\n“But I can't live on twelve,” I explained.\r\n\r\n“Can't live on twelve! Do you know why? Because you don't know how to\r\nlive. I know you all. One veal and ham pie, one roley-poley, one Dutch\r\ncheese and a pint of bitter.”\r\n\r\nHis recital made my mouth water.\r\n\r\n“You overload your stomachs, then you can't work. Half the diseases you\r\nyoung fellows suffer from are brought about by overeating.”\r\n\r\n“Now, you take my advice,” continued Mr. Lott; “try vegetarianism. In\r\nthe morning, a little oatmeal. Wonderfully strengthening stuff, oatmeal:\r\nlook at the Scotch. For dinner, beans. Why, do you know there's\r\nmore nourishment in half a pint of lentil beans than in a pound of\r\nbeefsteak--more gluten. That's what you want, more gluten; no corpses,\r\nno dead bodies.

How much do you pay for your room?”\r\n\r\nI told him.\r\n\r\n“Four-and-a-penny and two-and-six makes six-and-seven. That leaves you\r\nfive and fivepence for mere foolery. Good God! what more do you want?”\r\n\r\n“I'll take eighteen, sir,” I answered. “I can't really manage on less.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, I won't beat you down,” he answered. “Fifteen shillings a\r\nweek.”\r\n\r\n“I said eighteen,” I persisted.\r\n\r\n“Well, and I said fifteen,” he retorted, somewhat indignant at the\r\nquibbling. “That's splitting the difference, isn't it? I can't be fairer\r\nthan that.”\r\n\r\nI dared not throw away the one opportunity that had occurred. Anything\r\nwas better than return to the Reading Rooms, and the empty days full of\r\ndespair. I accepted, and it was agreed that I should come the following\r\nMonday morning.\r\n\r\n“Nabbed?” was Minikin's enquiry on my return to the back office for my\r\nhat.\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“What's he wasting on you?”\r\n\r\n“Fifteen shillings a week,” I whispered.\r\n\r\n“Felt sure somehow that he'd take a liking to you,” answered Minikin.\r\n“Don't be ungrateful and look thin on it.”\r\n\r\nOutside the door I heard Mr. Lott's shrill voice demanding to know where\r\npostage stamps were to be found.\r\n\r\n“At the Post-office,” was Minikin's reply.\r\n\r\nThe hours were long--in fact, we had no office hours; we got away\r\nwhen we could, which was rarely before seven or eight--but my work was\r\ninteresting. It consisted of buying for unfortunate clients in India or\r\nthe Colonies anything they might happen to want, from a stage coach to\r\na pot of marmalade; packing it and shipping it across to them. Our\r\n“commission” was anything they could be persuaded to pay over and above\r\nthe value of the article. I was not much interfered with. There was that\r\nto be said for Lott & Co., so long as the work was done he was quite\r\ncontent to leave one to one's own way of doing it. And hastening through\r\nthe busy streets, bargaining in shop or warehouse, bustling important in\r\nand out the swarming docks, I often thanked my stars that I was not as\r\nsome poor two-pound-a-week clerk chained to a dreary desk.\r\n\r\nThe fifteen shillings a week was a tight fit; but that was not my\r\ntrouble. Reduce your denominator--you know the quotation. I found it no\r\nphilosophical cant, but a practical solution of life. My food cost me\r\non the average a shilling a day. If more of us limited our commissariat\r\nbill to the same figure, there would be less dyspepsia abroad. Generally\r\nI cooked my own meals in my own frying-pan; but occasionally I would\r\nindulge myself with a more orthodox dinner at a cook shop, or tea with\r\nhot buttered toast at a coffee-shop; and but for the greasy table-cloth\r\nand the dirty-handed waiter, such would have been even greater\r\ndelights. The shilling a week for amusements afforded me at least one,\r\noccasionally two, visits to the theatre, for in those days there were\r\nParadises where for sixpence one could be a god. Fourpence a week on\r\ntobacco gave me half-a-dozen cigarettes a day; I have spent more on\r\nsmoke and derived less satisfaction. Dress was my greatest difficulty.\r\nOne anxiety in life the poor man is saved: he knows not the haunting\r\nsense of debt. My tailor never dunned me. His principle was half-a-crown\r\ndown on receipt of order, the balance on the handing over of the goods.\r\nNo system is perfect; the method avoided friction, it is true; yet\r\non the other hand it was annoying to be compelled to promenade, come\r\nSundays, in shiny elbows and frayed trousers, knowing all the while\r\nthat finished, waiting, was a suit in which one might have made one's\r\nmark--had only one shut one's eyes passing that pastry-cook's window on\r\npay-day. Surely there should be a sumptuary law compelling pastry-cooks\r\nto deal in cellars or behind drawn blinds.\r\n\r\nWere it because of its mere material hardships that to this day I think\r\nof that period of my life with a shudder, I should not here confess to\r\nit. I was alone. I knew not a living soul to whom I dared to speak, who\r\ncared to speak to me. For those first twelve months after my mother's\r\ndeath I lived alone, thought alone, felt alone. In the morning, during\r\nthe busy day, it was possible to bear; but in the evenings the sense\r\nof desolation gripped me like a physical pain. The summer evenings\r\ncame again, bringing with them the long, lingering light so laden with\r\nmelancholy. I would walk into the Parks and, sitting there, watch with\r\nhungry eyes the men and women, boys and girls, moving all around me,\r\ntalking, laughing, interested in one another; feeling myself some\r\nspeechless ghost, seeing but not seen, crying to the living with a voice\r\nthey heard not. Sometimes a solitary figure would pass by and glance\r\nback at me; some lonely creature like myself longing for human sympathy.\r\nIn the teeming city must have been thousands such--young men and women\r\nto whom a friendly ear, a kindly voice, would have been as the water of\r\nlife. Each imprisoned in his solitary cell of shyness, we looked at one\r\nanother through the grating with condoling eyes; further than that\r\nwas forbidden to us. Once, in Kensington Gardens, a woman turned, then\r\nslowly retracing her steps, sat down beside me on the bench. Neither of\r\nus spoke; had I done so she would have risen and moved away; yet there\r\nwas understanding between us. To each of us it was some comfort to sit\r\nthus for a little while beside the other. Had she poured out her heart\r\nto me, she could have told me nothing more than I knew: “I, too, am\r\nlonely, friendless; I, too, long for the sound of a voice, the touch of\r\na hand. It is hard for you, it is harder still for me, a girl; shut out\r\nfrom the bright world that laughs around me; denied the right of\r\nyouth to joy and pleasure; denied the right of womanhood to love and\r\ntenderness.”\r\n\r\nThe footsteps to and fro grew fewer. She moved to rise. Stirred by an\r\nimpulse, I stretched out my hand, then seeing the flush upon her face,\r\ndrew it back hastily. But the next moment, changing her mind, she held\r\nhers out to me, and I took it. It was the first clasp of a hand I had\r\nfelt since six months before I had said good-bye to Hal. She turned and\r\nwalked quickly away. I stood watching her; she never looked round, and I\r\nnever saw her again.\r\n\r\nI take no credit to myself for keeping straight, as it is termed, during\r\nthese days. For good or evil, my shyness prevented my taking part in the\r\nflirtations of the streets. Whether inviting eyes were ever thrown to me\r\nas to others, I cannot say. Sometimes, fancying so--hoping so, I would\r\nfollow. Yet never could I summon up sufficient resolution to face the\r\npossible rebuff before some less timid swain would swoop down upon the\r\nquarry. Then I would hurry on, cursing myself for the poorness of my\r\nspirit, fancying mocking contempt in the laughter that followed me.\r\n\r\nOn a Sunday I would rise early and take long solitary walks into the\r\ncountry.

One winter's day--I remember it was on the road between Edgware\r\nand Stanmore--there issued from a by-road a little ahead of me a party\r\nof boys and girls, young people about my own age, bound evidently on\r\na skating expedition. I could hear the musical ring of their blades,\r\nclattering as they walked, and the sound of their merry laughter so\r\nclear and bell-like through the frosty air. And an aching anguish fell\r\nupon me. I felt a mad desire to run after them, to plead with them to\r\nlet me walk with them a little way, to let me laugh and talk with them.\r\nEvery now and then they would pirouette to cry some jest to one another.\r\nI could see their faces: the girls' so sweetly alluring, framed by their\r\ndainty hats and furs, the bright colour in their cheeks, the light\r\nin their teasing eyes. A little further on they turned aside into a\r\nby-lane, and I stood at the corner listening till the last echo of their\r\njoyous voices died away, and on a stone that still remains standing\r\nthere I sat down and sobbed.\r\n\r\nI would walk about the streets always till very late. I dreaded the\r\nechoing clang of the little front door when I closed it behind me, the\r\nclimbing of the silent stairs, the solitude that waited for me in my\r\nempty room. It would rise and come towards me like some living thing,\r\nkissing me with cold lips. Often, unable to bear the closeness of its\r\npresence, I would creep out into the streets. There, even though it\r\nfollowed me, I was not alone with it. Sometimes I would pace them the\r\nwhole night, sharing them with the other outcasts while the city slept.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, during these nightly wanderings would come to me moments\r\nof exaltation when fear fell from me and my blood would leap with joy at\r\nprospect of the fierce struggle opening out before me. Then it was the\r\nghostly city sighing round me that seemed dead, I the only living thing\r\nreal among a world of shadows. In long, echoing streets I would laugh\r\nand shout. Misunderstanding policemen would turn their bull's-eyes on\r\nme, gruffly give me practical advice: they knew not who I was! I stood\r\nthe centre of a vast galanty-show: the phantom houses came and went;\r\nfrom some there shone bright lights; the doors were open, and little\r\nfigures flitted in and out, the tiny coaches glided to and fro, manikins\r\ngrotesque but pitiful crept across the star-lit curtain.\r\n\r\nThen the mood would change. The city, grim and vast, stretched round\r\nme endless. I crawled, a mere atom, within its folds, helpless,\r\ninsignificant, absurd. The houseless forms that shared my vigil were\r\nmy fellows. What were we? Animalcule upon its bosom, that it saw not,\r\nheeded not. For company I would mingle with them: ragged men, frowsy\r\nwomen, ageless youths, gathered round the red glow of some coffee stall.\r\n\r\nRarely would we speak to one another. More like animals we browsed\r\nthere, sipping the halfpenny cup of hot water coloured with coffee\r\ngrounds (at least it was warm), munching the moist slab of coarse cake;\r\nlooking with dull, indifferent eyes each upon the wretchedness of\r\nthe others. Perhaps some two would whisper to each other in listless,\r\nmonotonous tone, broken here and there by a short, mirthless laugh; some\r\nshivering creature, not yet case-hardened to despair, seek, perhaps,\r\nthe relief of curses that none heeded. Later, a faint chill breeze would\r\nshake the shadows loose, a thin, wan light streak the dark air with\r\nshade, and silently, stealthily, we would fade away and disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPAUL, ESCAPING FROM HIS SOLITUDE, FALLS INTO STRANGE COMPANY. AND\r\nBECOMES CAPTIVE TO ONE OF HAUGHTY MIEN.\r\n\r\nAll things pass, even the self-inflicted sufferings of shy young men,\r\ncondemned by temperament to solitude. Came the winter evenings, I took\r\nto work: in it one may drown much sorrow for oneself. With its handful\r\nof fire, its two candles lighted, my “apartment” was more inviting.\r\nI bought myself paper, pens and ink. Great or small, what more can a\r\nwriter do? He is but the would-be medium: will the spirit voices employ\r\nhim or reject him?\r\n\r\nLondon, with its million characters, grave and gay; its ten thousand\r\nromances, its mysteries, its pathos, and its humour, lay to my hand. It\r\nstretched before me, asking only intelligent observation, more or less\r\ntruthful report. But that I could make a story out of the things I\r\nreally knew never occurred to me. My tales were of cottage maidens, of\r\nbucolic yeomen. My scenes were laid in windmills, among mountains, or in\r\nmoated granges. I fancy this phase of folly is common to most youthful\r\nfictionists.\r\n\r\nA trail of gentle melancholy lay over them. Sentiment was more popular\r\nthen than it is now, and, as do all beginners, I scrupulously followed\r\nfashion. Generally speaking, to be a heroine of mine was fatal. However\r\nnaturally her hair might curl--and curly hair, I believe, is the\r\nhall-mark of vitality; whatever other indications of vigorous health she\r\nmight exhibit in the first chapter, such as “dancing eyes,” “colour\r\nthat came and went,” “ringing laughter,” “fawn-like agility,” she was\r\ntolerably certain, poor girl, to end in an untimely grave. Snowdrops and\r\nearly primroses (my botany I worked up from a useful little volume, “Our\r\nGarden Favourites, Illustrated”) grew there as in a forcing house; and\r\nif in the neighbourhood of the coast, the sea-breezes would choose\r\nthat particular churchyard, somewhat irreverently, for their favourite\r\nplayground. Years later a white-haired man would come there leading\r\nlittle children by the hand, and to them he would tell the tale anew,\r\nwhich must have been a dismal entertainment for them.\r\n\r\nNow and then, by way of change, it would be the gentleman who would\r\nfall a victim of the deadly atmosphere of my literature. It was of\r\nno particular consequence, so he himself would conclude in his last\r\nsoliloquy; “it was better so.” Snowdrops and primroses, for whatever\r\nconsolation they might have been to him, it was hopeless for him to\r\nexpect; his grave, marked by a rude cross, being as a rule situate in an\r\nexceptionally unfrequented portion of the African veldt or amid burning\r\nsands. For description of final scenery on these occasions a visit to\r\nthe British Museum reading-room would be necessary.\r\n\r\nDismal little fledgelings! And again and again would I drive them from\r\nthe nest; again and again they fluttered back to me, soiled, crumpled,\r\nphysically damaged. Yet one person had admired them, cried over\r\nthem--myself.\r\n\r\nAll methods I tried. Sometimes I would send them forth accompanied by\r\na curt business note of the take-it-or-leave-it order. At other times I\r\nwould attach to it pathetic appeals for its consideration. Sometimes\r\nI would give value to it, stating that the price was five guineas and\r\nrequesting that the cheque should be crossed; at other times seek to\r\ntickle editorial cupidity by offering this, my first contribution to\r\ntheir pages, for nothing--my sample packet, so to speak, sent gratis,\r\none trial surely sufficient. Now I would write sarcastically, enclosing\r\ntogether with the stamped envelope for return a brutally penned note of\r\nrejection. Or I would write frankly, explaining elaborately that I was a\r\nbeginner, and asking to be told my faults--if any.\r\n\r\nNot one found a resting place for its feet.

Or I would write frankly, explaining elaborately that I was a\r\nbeginner, and asking to be told my faults--if any.\r\n\r\nNot one found a resting place for its feet. A month, a week, a couple of\r\ndays, they would remain away from me, then return. I never lost a single\r\none. I wished I had. It would have varied the monotony.\r\n\r\nI hated the poor little slavey who, bursting joyously into the room,\r\nwould hold them out to me from between her apron-hidden thumb and\r\nfinger; her chronic sniff I translated into contempt. If flying down the\r\nstairs at the sound of the postman's knock I secured it from his hands,\r\nit seemed to me he smiled. Tearing them from their envelopes, I would\r\ncurse them, abuse them, fling them into the fire sometimes; but before\r\nthey were more than scorched I would snatch them out, smooth them,\r\nreread them. The editor himself could never have seen them; it was\r\nimpossible; some jealous underling had done this thing. I had sent them\r\nto the wrong paper. They had arrived at the inopportune moment. Their\r\ntriumph would come. Rewriting the first and last sheets, I would send\r\nthem forth again with fresh hope.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, understanding that the would-be happy warrior must shine in\r\ncamp as well as field, I sought to fit myself also for the social side\r\nof life. Smoking and drinking were the twin sins I found most difficulty\r\nin acquiring. I am not claiming a mental excellence so much as\r\nconfessing a bodily infirmity. The spirit had always been willing, but\r\nmy flesh was weak. Fired by emulation, I had at school occasionally\r\nessayed a cigarette. The result had been distinctly unsatisfactory, and\r\nafter some two or three attempts, I had abandoned, for the time being,\r\nall further endeavour; excusing my faint-heartedness by telling myself\r\nwith sanctimonious air that smoking was bad for growing boys; attempting\r\nto delude myself by assuming, in presence of contemporaries of stronger\r\nstomach, fine pose of disapproval; yet in my heart knowing myself a\r\nyoung hypocrite, disguising physical cowardice in the robes of moral\r\ncourage: a self-deception to which human nature is prone.\r\n\r\nSo likewise now and again I had tasted the wine that was red, and that\r\nstood year in, year out, decanted on our sideboard. The true\r\ninwardness of St. Paul's prescription had been revealed to me; the\r\nattitude--sometimes sneered at--of those who drink it under doctor's\r\norders, regarding it purely as a medicine, appeared to me reasonable.\r\nI had noticed also that others, some of them grown men even, making wry\r\nfaces, when drinking my mother's claret, and had concluded therefrom\r\nthat taste for strong liquor was an accomplishment less easily acquired\r\nthan is generally supposed. The lack of it in a young man could be no\r\ndisgrace, and accordingly effort in that direction also had I weakly\r\npostponed.\r\n\r\nBut now, a gentleman at large, my education could no longer be delayed.\r\nTo the artist in particular was training--and severe training--an\r\nabsolute necessity. Recently fashion has changed somewhat, but a quarter\r\nof a century ago a genius who did not smoke and drink--and that more\r\nthan was good for him--would have been dismissed without further\r\nevidence as an impostor. About the genius I was hopeful, but at no time\r\npositively certain. As regarded the smoking and drinking, so much at\r\nleast I could make sure of. I set to work methodically, conscientiously.\r\nSmoking, experience taught me, was better practised on Saturday nights,\r\nSunday affording me the opportunity of walking off the effects. Patience\r\nand determination were eventually crowned with success: I learned to\r\nsmoke a cigarette to all appearance as though I were enjoying it. Young\r\nmen of less character might here have rested content, but attainment\r\nof the highest has always been with me a motive force. The cigarette\r\nconquered, I next proceeded to attack the cigar. My first one I remember\r\nwell: most men do. It was at a smoking concert held in the Islington\r\nDrill Hall, to which Minikin had invited me. Not feeling sure whether my\r\ngrowing dizziness were due solely to the cigar, or in part to the hot,\r\nover-crowded room, I made my excuses and slipped out. I found myself in\r\na small courtyard, divided from a neighbouring garden by a low wall. The\r\ncause of my trouble was clearly the cigar. My inclination was to take it\r\nfrom my mouth and see how far I could throw it. Conscience, on the other\r\nhand, urged me to persevere. It occurred to me that if climbing on to\r\nthe wall I could walk along it from end to end, there would be no excuse\r\nfor my not heeding the counsels of perfection. If, on the contrary, try\r\nas I might, the wall proved not wide enough for my footsteps, then I\r\nshould be entitled to lose the beastly thing, and, as best I could,\r\nmake my way home to bed. I attained the wall with some difficulty and\r\ncommenced my self-inflicted ordeal. Two yards further I found\r\nmyself lying across the wall, my legs hanging down one side, my head\r\noverhanging the other. The position proving suitable to my requirements,\r\nI maintained it. Inclination, again seizing its opportunity, urged me\r\nthen and there to take a solemn vow never to smoke again. I am proud\r\nto write that through that hour of temptation I remained firm;\r\nstrengthening myself by whispering to myself: “Never despair. What\r\nothers can do, so can you. Is not all victory won through suffering?”\r\n\r\nA liking for drink I had found, if possible, even yet more difficult of\r\nachievement. Spirits I almost despaired of. Once, confusing bottles, I\r\ndrank some hair oil in mistake for whiskey, and found it decidedly less\r\nnauseous. But twice a week I would force myself to swallow a glass of\r\nbeer, standing over myself insisting on my draining it to the bitter\r\ndregs. As reward afterwards, to take the taste out of my mouth, I\r\nwould treat myself to chocolates; at the same time comforting myself\r\nby assuring myself that it was for my good, that there would come a day\r\nwhen I should really like it, and be grateful to myself for having been\r\nsevere with myself.\r\n\r\nIn other and more sensible directions I sought also to progress.\r\nGradually I was overcoming my shyness. It was a slow process. I found\r\nthe best plan was not to mind being shy, to accept it as part of my\r\ntemperament, and with others laugh at it. The coldness of an indifferent\r\nworld is of service in hardening a too sensitive skin. The gradual\r\nrubbings of existence were rounding off my many corners. I became\r\npossible to my fellow creatures, and they to me. I began to take\r\npleasure in their company.\r\n\r\nBy directing me to this particular house in Nelson Square, Fate had\r\ndone to me a kindness. I flatter myself we were an interesting menagerie\r\ngathered together under its leaky roof. Mrs. Peedles, our landlady, who\r\nslept in the basement with the slavey, had been an actress in Charles\r\nKeane's company at the old Princess's. There, it is true, she had played\r\nonly insignificant parts. London, as she would explain to us was even\r\nthen but a poor judge of art, with prejudices. Besides an actor-manager,\r\nhampered by a wife--we understood. But previously in the Provinces there\r\nhad been a career of glory: Juliet, Amy Robsart, Mrs. Haller in “The\r\nStranger”--almost the entire roll of the “Legitimates”. Showed we any\r\nsigns of disbelief, proof was forthcoming: handbills a yard long, rich\r\nin notes of exclamation: “On Tuesday Evening! By Special Desire!!!\r\nBlessington's Theatre! In the Meadow, adjoining the Falcon Arms!”--“On\r\nSaturday", " Provinces there\r\nhad been a career of glory: Juliet, Amy Robsart, Mrs. Haller in “The\r\nStranger”--almost the entire roll of the “Legitimates”. Showed we any\r\nsigns of disbelief, proof was forthcoming: handbills a yard long, rich\r\nin notes of exclamation: “On Tuesday Evening! By Special Desire!!!\r\nBlessington's Theatre! In the Meadow, adjoining the Falcon Arms!”--“On\r\nSaturday! Under the Patronage of Col. Sir William and the Officers of\r\nthe 74th!!!! In the Corn Exchange!” Maybe it would convince us further\r\nwere she to run through a passage here and there, say Lady Macbeth's\r\nsleep-walking scene, or from Ophelia's entrance in the fourth act? It\r\nwould be no trouble; her memory was excellent. We would hasten to assure\r\nher of our perfect faith.\r\n\r\nListening to her, it was difficult, as she herself would frankly admit,\r\nto imagine her the once “arch Miss Lucretia Barry;” looking at her, to\r\nremember there had been an evening when she had been “the cynosure of\r\nevery eye.” One found it necessary to fortify oneself with perusal of\r\nunderlined extracts from ancient journals, much thumbed and creased,\r\nthoughtfully lent to one for the purpose. Since those days Fate had\r\nwoven round her a mantle of depression. She was now a faded, watery-eyed\r\nlittle woman, prone on the slightest provocation to sit down suddenly on\r\nthe nearest chair and at once commence a history of her troubles. Quite\r\nunconscious of this failing, it was an idea of hers that she was an\r\nexceptionally cheerful person.\r\n\r\n“But there, fretting's no good. We must grin and bear things in this\r\nworld,” she would conclude, wiping her eyes upon her apron. “It's better\r\nto laugh than to cry, I always say.” And to prove that this was no mere\r\nidle sentiment, she would laugh then and there upon the spot.\r\n\r\nMuch stair-climbing had bestowed upon her a shortness of breath, which\r\nno amount of panting in her resting moments was able to make good.\r\n\r\n“You don't know 'ow to breathe,” explained our second floor front to\r\nher on one occasion, a kindly young man; “you don't swallow it, you\r\nonly gargle with it. Take a good draught and shut your mouth; don't\r\nbe frightened of it; don't let it out again till it's done something:\r\nthat's what it's 'ere for.”\r\n\r\nHe stood over her with his handkerchief pressed against her mouth to\r\nassist her; but it was of no use.\r\n\r\n“There don't seem any room for it inside me,” she explained.\r\n\r\nBells had become to her the business of life; she lived listening\r\nfor them. Converse to her was a filling in of time while waiting for\r\ninterruptions.\r\n\r\nA bottle of whiskey fell into my hands that Christmas time, a present\r\nfrom a commercial traveller in the way of business. Not liking whiskey\r\nmyself, it was no sacrifice for me to reserve it for the occasional\r\ncomfort of Mrs. Peedles, when, breathless, with her hands to her side,\r\nshe would sink upon the chair nearest to my door. Her poor, washed-out\r\nface would lighten at the suggestion.\r\n\r\n“Ah, well,” she would reply, “I don't mind if I do. It's a poor heart\r\nthat never rejoices.”\r\n\r\nAnd then, her tongue unloosened, she would sit there and tell me stories\r\nof my predecessors, young men lodgers who like myself had taken her\r\nbed-sitting-rooms, and of the woes and misfortunes that had overtaken\r\nthem. I gathered that a more unlucky house I could not have selected.\r\nA former tenant of my own room, of whom I strangely reminded her, had\r\nwritten poetry on my very table. He was now in Portland doing five years\r\nfor forgery. Mrs. Peedles appeared to regard the two accomplishments as\r\nmerely different expressions of the same art. Another of her young men,\r\nas she affectionately called us, had been of studious ambition. His\r\ncareer up to a point appeared to have been brilliant. “What he mightn't\r\nhave been,” according to Mrs. Peedles, there was practically no saying;\r\nwhat he happened to be at the moment of conversation was an unpromising\r\ninmate of the Hanwell lunatic asylum.\r\n\r\n“I've always noticed it,” Mrs. Peedles would explain; “it's always the\r\nmost deserving, those that try hardest, to whom trouble comes. I'm sure\r\nI don't know why.”\r\n\r\nI was glad on the whole when that bottle of whiskey was finished. A\r\nsecond might have driven me to suicide.\r\n\r\nThere was no Mr. Peedles--at least, not for Mrs. Peedles, though as an\r\nindividual he continued to exist. He had been “general utility” at\r\nthe Princess's--the old terms were still in vogue at that time--a fine\r\nfigure of a man in his day, so I was given to understand, but one easily\r\nled away, especially by minxes. Mrs. Peedles spoke bitterly of general\r\nutilities as people of not much use.\r\n\r\nFor working days Mrs. Peedles had one dress and one cap, both black\r\nand void of ostentation; but on Sundays and holidays she would appear\r\nmetamorphosed. She had carefully preserved the bulk of her stage\r\nwardrobe, even to the paste-decked shoes and tinsel jewelry. Shapeless\r\nin classic garb as Hermia, or bulgy in brocade and velvet as Lady\r\nTeazle, she would receive her few visitors on Sunday evenings, discarded\r\npuppets like herself, with whom the conversation was of gayer nights\r\nbefore their wires had been cut; or, her glory hid from the ribald\r\nstreet beneath a mackintosh, pay her few calls. Maybe it was the unusual\r\nexcitement that then brought colour into her furrowed cheeks, that\r\nstraightened and darkened her eyebrows, at other times so singularly\r\nunobtrusive. Be this how it may, the change was remarkable, only\r\nthe thin grey hair and the work-worn hands remaining for purposes of\r\nidentification. Nor was the transformation merely one of surface.\r\nMrs. Peedles hung on her hook behind the kitchen door, dingy, limp,\r\ndiscarded; out of the wardrobe with the silks and satins was lifted down\r\nto be put on as an undergarment Miss Lucretia Barry, like her costumes\r\nsomewhat aged, somewhat withered, but still distinctly “arch.”\r\n\r\nIn the room next to me lived a law-writer and his wife. They were very\r\nold and miserably poor. The fault was none of theirs. Despite copy-books\r\nmaxims, there is in this world such a thing as ill-luck-persistent,\r\nmonotonous, that gradually wears away all power of resistance. I\r\nlearned from them their history: it was hopelessly simple, hopelessly\r\nuninstructive. He had been a schoolmaster, she a pupil teacher; they had\r\nmarried young, and for a while the world had smiled upon them. Then came\r\nillness, attacking them both: nothing out of which any moral could be\r\ndeduced, a mere case of bad drains resulting in typhoid fever. They had\r\nstarted again, saddled by debt, and after years of effort had succeeded\r\nin clearing themselves, only to fall again, this time in helping a\r\nfriend. Nor was it even a case of folly: a poor man who had helped them\r\nin their trouble, hardly could they have done otherwise without proving\r\nthemselves ungrateful. And so on, a tedious tale, commonplace, trivial.\r\nNow listless, patient, hard working, they had arrived at an animal-like\r\nindifference to their fate, content so long as they could obtain the\r\nbare necessities of existence, passive when these were not forthcoming,\r\ntheir interest in life limited to the one luxury of the poor--an\r\noccasional glass of beer or spirits. Often days would go by without\r\nhis obtaining any work, and then they would more or less starve. Law\r\ndocuments are generally given out to such men in the evening, to be\r\nreturned finished the next morning. Waking in the night, I would hear\r\nthrough the thin wooden partition that divided our rooms the even\r\nscratching of his pen.\r\n\r\nThus cheek", ",\r\ntheir interest in life limited to the one luxury of the poor--an\r\noccasional glass of beer or spirits.

Past his door I\r\nwould slink on tiptoe, dread meeting him upon the stairs. Once had not\r\nhe said to himself: “The world's mine oyster?” May not the voices of the\r\nnight have proclaimed him also king? Might I not be but an idle dreamer,\r\nmistaking desire for power? Would not the world prove stronger than I?\r\nAt such times I would see my life before me: the clerkship at thirty\r\nshillings a week rising by slow instalments, it may be, to one hundred\r\nand fifty a year; the four-roomed house at Brixton; the girl wife,\r\npretty, perhaps, but sinking so soon into the slatternly woman; the\r\nsqualling children. How could I, unaided, expect to raise myself from\r\nthe ruck? Was not this the more likely picture?\r\n\r\nOur second floor front was a young fellow in the commercial line. Jarman\r\nwas Young London personified--blatant yet kind-hearted; aggressively\r\nself-assertive, generous to a fault; cunning, yet at the same time\r\nfrank; shrewd, cheery, and full of pluck. “Never say die” was his motto,\r\nand anything less dead it would be difficult to imagine. All day long\r\nhe was noisy, and all night long he snored. He woke with a start, bathed\r\nlike a porpoise, sang while dressing, roared for his boots, and\r\nwhistled during his breakfast. His entrance and exit were always to an\r\norchestration of banging doors, directions concerning his meals shouted\r\nat the top of his voice as he plunged up or down the stairs, the\r\nclattering and rattling of brooms and pails flying before his feet. His\r\ndeparture always left behind it the suggestion that the house was now to\r\nlet; it came almost as a shock to meet a human being on the landing. He\r\nwould have conveyed an atmosphere of bustle to the Egyptian pyramids.\r\n\r\nSometimes carrying his own supper-tray, arranged for two, he would march\r\ninto my room. At first, resenting his familiarity, I would hint at my\r\ndesire to be alone, would explain that I was busy.\r\n\r\n“You fire away, Shakespeare Redivivus,” he would reply. “Don't delay the\r\ntragedy. Why should London wait? I'll keep quiet.”\r\n\r\nBut his notion of keeping quiet was to retire into a corner and there\r\namuse himself by enacting a tragedy of his own in a hoarse whisper,\r\naccompanied by appropriate gesture.\r\n\r\n“Ah, ah!” I would hear him muttering to himself, “I 'ave killed 'er good\r\nold father; I 'ave falsely accused 'er young man of all the crimes that\r\nI 'ave myself committed; I 'ave robbed 'er of 'er ancestral estates. Yet\r\nshe loves me not! It is streeange!” Then changing his bass to a shrill\r\nfalsetto: “It is a cold and dismal night: the snow falls fast. I will\r\nleave me 'at and umbrella be'ind the door and go out for a walk with the\r\nchee-ild. Aha! who is this? 'E also 'as forgotten 'is umbrella. Ah, now\r\nI know 'im in the pitch dark by 'is cigarette! Villain, murderer, silly\r\njosser! it is you!” Then with lightning change of voice and gesture:\r\n“Mary, I love yer!” “Sir Jasper Murgatroyd, let me avail myself of this\r\nopportunity to tell you what I think of you--” “No, no; the 'ouses close\r\nin 'alf an hour; there is not tee-ime. Fly with me instead!” “Never!\r\nUn'and me!” “'Ear me! Ah, what 'ave I done? I 'ave slipped upon a piece\r\nof orange peel and broke me 'ead! If you will kindly ask them to turn\r\noff the snow and give me a little moonlight, I will confess all.”\r\n\r\nFinding it (much to Jarman's surprise) impossible to renew the thread of\r\nmy work, I would abandon my attempts at literature, and instead listen\r\nto his talk, which was always interesting. His conversation was, it is\r\ntrue, generally about himself, but it was none the less attractive on\r\nthat account. His love affairs, which appeared to be numerous, formed\r\nhis chief topic. There was no reserve about Jarman: his life contained\r\nno secret chambers. What he “told her straight,” what she “up and said\r\nto him” in reply was for all the world that cared to hear. So far his\r\nsearch after the ideal had met with but ill success.\r\n\r\n“Girls,” he would say, “they're all alike, till you know 'em. So long as\r\nthey're trying to palm themselves off on yer, they'll persuade you\r\nthere isn't such another article in all the market. When they've got yer\r\norder--ah, then yer find out what they're really made of. And you take\r\nit from me, 'Omer Junior, most of 'em are put together cheap. Bah!\r\nit sickens me sometimes to read the way you paper-stainers talk about 'em\r\n--angels, goddesses, fairies! They've just been getting at yer. You're\r\ngiving 'em just the price they're asking without examining the article.\r\nGirls ain't a special make, like what you seem to think 'em. We're all\r\nturned out of the same old slop shop.”\r\n\r\n“Not that I say, mind yer,” he would continue, “that there are none of\r\nthe right sort. They're to be 'ad--real good 'uns. All I say is, taking\r\n'em at their own valuation ain't the way to do business with 'em.”\r\n\r\nWhat he was on the look out for--to quote his own description--was a\r\nreally first class article, not something from which the paint would\r\ncome off almost before you got it home.\r\n\r\n“They're to be found,” he would cheerfully affirm, “but you've got to\r\nlook for 'em. They're not the sort that advertises.”\r\n\r\nBehind Jarman in the second floor back resided one whom Jarman had\r\nnicknamed “The Lady 'Ortensia.” I believe before my arrival there had\r\nbeen love passages between the two; but neither of them, so I gathered,\r\nhad upon closer inspection satisfied the other's standard. Their present\r\nattitude towards each other was that of insult thinly veiled under\r\nexaggerated politeness. Miss Rosina Sellars was, in her own language,\r\na “lady assistant,” in common parlance, a barmaid at the Ludgate Hill\r\nStation refreshment room. She was a large, flabby young woman. With less\r\npowder, her complexion might by admirers have been termed creamy; as it\r\nwas, it presented the appearance rather of underdone pastry. To be on\r\nall occasions “quite the lady” was her pride. There were those who held\r\nthe angle of her dignity to be exaggerated. Jarman would beg her for her\r\nown sake to be more careful lest one day she should fall down backwards\r\nand hurt herself. On the other hand, her bearing was certainly\r\ncalculated to check familiarity. Even stockbrokers' clerks--young men\r\nas a class with the bump of reverence but poorly developed--would in her\r\npresence falter and grow hesitating. She had cultivated the art of\r\nnot noticing to something approaching perfection. She could draw the\r\nnoisiest customer a glass of beer, which he had never ordered; exchange\r\nit for three of whiskey, which he had; take his money and return him his\r\nchange without ever seeing him, hearing him, or knowing he was there. It\r\nshattered the self-assertion of the youngest of commercial travellers.\r\nHer", " developed--would in her\r\npresence falter and grow hesitating.

It\r\nshattered the self-assertion of the youngest of commercial travellers.\r\nHer tone and manner, outside rare moments of excitement, were suggestive\r\nof an offended but forgiving iceberg. Jarman invariably passed her with\r\nhis coat collar turned up to his ears, and even thus protected might\r\nhave been observed to shiver. Her stare, in conjunction with her “I beg\r\nyour pardon!” was a moral douche that would have rendered apologetic and\r\nexplanatory Don Juan himself.\r\n\r\nTo me she was always gracious, which by contrast to her general attitude\r\ntowards my sex of studied disdain, I confess flattered me. She was good\r\nenough to observe to Mrs. Peedles, who repeated it to me, that I was the\r\nonly gentleman in the house who knew how to behave himself.\r\n\r\nThe entire first floor was occupied by an Irishman and--they never\r\nminced the matter themselves, so hardly is there need for me to do so.\r\nShe was a charming little dark-eyed woman, an ex-tight-rope dancer, and\r\nalways greatly offended Mrs. Peedles by claiming Miss Lucretia Barry as\r\na sister artiste.\r\n\r\n“Of course I don't know how it may be now,” would reply Mrs. Peedles,\r\nwith some slight asperity; “but in my time we ladies of the legitimate\r\nstage used to look down upon dancers and such sort. Of course, no\r\noffence to you, Mrs. O'Kelly.”\r\n\r\nNeither of them was in the least offended.\r\n\r\n“Sure, Mrs. Peedles, ye could never have looked down upon the Signora,”\r\n the O'Kelly would answer laughing. “Ye had to lie back and look up to\r\nher. Why, I've got the crick in me neck to this day!”\r\n\r\n“Ah! my dear, and you don't know how nervous I was when glancing down\r\nI'd see his handsome face just underneath me, thinking that with one\r\nfalse step I might spoil it for ever,” would reply the Signora.\r\n\r\n“Me darling! I'd have died happy, just smothered in loveliness!” would\r\nreturn the O'Kelly; and he and the Signora would rush into each other's\r\narms, and the sound of their kisses would quite excite the little slavey\r\nsweeping down the stairs outside.\r\n\r\nHe was a barrister attached in theory to the Western Circuit; in\r\npractice, somewhat indifferent to it, much more attached to the lower\r\nstrata of Bohemia and the Signora. At the present he was earning all\r\nsufficient for the simple needs of himself and the Signora as a teacher\r\nof music and singing. His method was simple and suited admirably the\r\nlocality. Unless specially requested, he never troubled his pupils with\r\nsuch tiresome things as scales and exercises. His plan was to discover\r\nthe song the young man fancied himself singing, the particular jingle\r\nthe young lady yearned to knock out of the piano, and to teach it to\r\nthem. Was it “Tom Bowling?” Well and good. Come on; follow your leader.\r\nThe O'Kelly would sing the first line.\r\n\r\n“Now then, try that. Don't be afraid. Just open yer mouth and gave it\r\ntongue. That's all right. Everything has a beginning. Sure, later on,\r\nwe'll get the time and tune, maybe a little expression.”\r\n\r\nWhether the system had any merit in it, I cannot answer. Certain it was\r\nthat as often as not it achieved success. Gradually--say, by the end\r\nof twelve eighteen-penny lessons--out of storm and chaos “Tom Bowling”\r\n would emerge, recognisable for all men to hear. Had the pupil any voice\r\nto start with, the O'Kelly improved it; had he none, the O'Kelly would\r\nhelp him to disguise the fact.\r\n\r\n“Take it easy, now; take it easy,” the O'Kelly would counsel. “Sure,\r\nit's a delicate organ, yer voice. Don't ye strain it now. Ye're at yer\r\nbest when ye're just low and sweet.”\r\n\r\nSo also with the blushing pianiste. At the end of a month a tune was\r\ndistinctly discernible; she could hear it herself, and was happy. His\r\nrepute spread.\r\n\r\nTwice already had he eloped with the Signora (and twice again was he\r\nto repeat the operation, before I finally lost sight of him: to break\r\noneself of habit is always difficult) and once by well-meaning friends\r\nhad he been induced to return to home, if not to beauty. His wife, who\r\nwas considerably older than himself, possessed, so he would inform\r\nme with tears in his eyes, every moral excellence that should attract\r\nmankind. Upon her goodness and virtue, her piety and conscientiousness\r\nhe would descant to me by the half hour. His sincerity it was impossible\r\nto question. It was beyond doubt that he respected her, admired her,\r\nhonoured her. She was a saint, an angel--a wretch, a villain such as he,\r\nwas not fit to breathe the same pure air. To do him justice, it must\r\nbe admitted he showed no particular desire to do so. As an aunt or\r\ngrandmother, I believe he would have suffered her gladly. He had nothing\r\nto say against her, except that he found himself unable to live with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThat she must have been a lady of exceptional merit one felt convinced.\r\nThe Signora, who had met her only once, and then under somewhat trying\r\nconditions, spoke her praises with equal enthusiasm. Had she, the\r\nSignora, enjoyed the advantage of meeting such a model earlier, she,\r\nthe Signora, might have been a better woman. It seemed a pity the\r\nintroduction could not have taken place sooner and under different\r\ncircumstances. Could they both have adopted her as a sort of mutual\r\nmother-in-law, it would have given them, I am positive, the greatest\r\nsatisfaction. On her occasional visits they would have vied with each\r\nother in showing her affectionate attention. For the deserted lady I\r\ntried to feel sorry, but could not avoid the reflection that it\r\nwould have been better for all parties had she been less patient and\r\nforgiving. Her husband was evidently much more suited to the Signora.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the relationship between these two was more a true marriage than\r\none generally meets with. No pair of love-birds could have been more\r\nsnug together. In their virtues and failings alike they fitted each\r\nother. When sober the immorality of their behaviour never troubled them;\r\nin fact, when sober nothing ever troubled them. They laughed, joked,\r\nplayed through life, two happy children. To be shocked at them was\r\nimpossible. I tried it and failed.\r\n\r\nBut now and again there came an evening when they were not sober. It\r\nhappened when funds were high. On such occasion the O'Kelly would return\r\nladen with bottles of a certain sweet champagne, of which they were both\r\nextremely fond; and a friend or two would be invited to share in the\r\nfestivity. Whether any exceptional quality resided in this particular\r\nbrand of champagne I am not prepared to argue; my own personal\r\nexperience of it has prompted me to avoid it for the rest of my life.\r\nIts effect upon them was certainly unique. Instead of intoxicating them,\r\nit sobered them: there is no other way of explaining it. With the third\r\nor fourth glass they began to take serious views of life. Before the end\r\nof the second bottle they would be staring at each other, appalled\r\nat contemplation of their own transgression. The Signora, the tears\r\nstreaming down her pretty face, would declare herself a wicked, wicked\r\nwoman; she had dragged down into shame the most blameless, the most\r\nvirtuous of men. Emptying her glass, she would bury her face in her\r\nhands, and with her elbows on her knees, in an agony of remorse, sit\r\nrocking to and fro. The O'Kelly, throwing himself at her feet, would\r\npassionately abjure her to “look up.” She had,", "streaming down her pretty face, would declare herself a wicked, wicked\r\nwoman; she had dragged down into shame the most blameless, the most\r\nvirtuous of men. Emptying her glass, she would bury her face in her\r\nhands, and with her elbows on her knees, in an agony of remorse, sit\r\nrocking to and fro. The O'Kelly, throwing himself at her feet, would\r\npassionately abjure her to “look up.” She had, it appeared, got hold of\r\nthe thing at the wrong end; it was he who had dragged her down.\r\n\r\nAt this point metaphor would become confused. Each had been dragged\r\ndown by the other one and ruined; also each one was the other one's good\r\nangel. All that was commendable in the Signora, she owed to the O'Kelly.\r\nWhatever was not discreditable about the O'Kelly was in the nature of a\r\nloan from the Signora. With the help of more champagne the right course\r\nwould grow plain to them. She would go back broken-hearted but repentant\r\nto the tight-rope; he would return a better but a blighted man to\r\nMrs. O'Kelly and the Western Circuit. This would be their last evening\r\ntogether on earth. A fresh bottle would be broached, and the guest or\r\nguests called upon to assist in the ceremony of renunciation; glasses\r\nfull to the brim this time.\r\n\r\nSo much tragedy did they continue to instil into the scene that on the\r\nfirst occasion of my witnessing it I was unable to refrain from mingling\r\nmy tears with theirs. As, however, the next morning they had forgotten\r\nall about it, and as nothing came of it, nor of several subsequent\r\nrepetitions, I should have believed a separation between them impossible\r\nbut that even while I was an inmate of the house the thing actually\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nIt came about in this wise. His friends, having discovered him, had\r\npointed out to him again his duty. The Signora--a really excellent\r\nlittle woman so far as intention was concerned--had seconded their\r\nendeavours, with the result that on a certain evening in autumn we of\r\nthe house assembled all of us on the first floor to support them on the\r\noccasion of their final--so we all deemed it then--leave-taking. For\r\neleven o'clock two four-wheeled cabs had been ordered, one to transport\r\nthe O'Kelly with his belongings to Hampstead and respectability; in the\r\nother the Signora would journey sorrowfully to the Tower Basin, there to\r\njoin a circus company sailing for the Continent.\r\n\r\nI knocked at the door some quarter of an hour before the appointed hour\r\nof the party. I fancy the idea had originated with the Signora.\r\n\r\n“Dear Willie has something to say to you,” she had informed me that\r\nmorning on the stairs. “He has taken a sincere liking to you, and it is\r\nsomething very important.”\r\n\r\nThey were sitting one each side the fireplace, looking very serious; a\r\nbottle of the sobering champagne stood upon the table. The Signora rose\r\nand kissed me gravely on the brow; the O'Kelly laid both hands upon my\r\nshoulders, and sat me down on a chair between them.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Kelver,” said the Signora, “you are very young.”\r\n\r\nI hinted--it was one of those rare occasions upon which gallantry can be\r\ncombined with truth--that I found myself in company.\r\n\r\nThe Signora smiled sadly, and shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Age,” said the O'Kelly, “is a matter of feeling. Kelver, may ye never\r\nbe as old as I am feeling now.”\r\n\r\n“As _we_ are feeling,” corrected the Signora. “Kelver,” said the\r\nO'Kelly, pouring out a third glass of champagne, “we want ye to promise\r\nus something.”\r\n\r\n“It will make us both happier,” added the Signora.\r\n\r\n“That ye will take warning,” continued the O'Kelly, “by our wretched\r\nexample. Paul, in this world there is only one path to possible\r\nhappiness. The path of strict--” he paused.\r\n\r\n“Propriety,” suggested the Signora.\r\n\r\n“Of strict propriety,” agreed the O'Kelly. “Deviate from it,” continued\r\nthe O'Kelly, impressively, “and what is the result?”\r\n\r\n“Unutterable misery,” supplied the Signora.\r\n\r\n“Ye think we two have been happy here together,” said the O'Kelly.\r\n\r\nI replied that such was the conclusion to which observation had directed\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“We tried to appear so,” explained the Signora; “it was merely on the\r\noutside. In reality all the time we hated each other. Tell him, Willie,\r\ndear, how we have hated each other.”\r\n\r\n“It is impossible,” said the O'Kelly, finishing and putting down his\r\nglass, “to give ye any idea, Kelver, how we have hated each other.”\r\n\r\n“How we have quarrelled!” said the Signora. “Tell him, dear, how we have\r\nquarrelled.”\r\n\r\n“All day long and half the night,” concluded the O'Kelly.\r\n\r\n“Fought,” added the Signora. “You see, Mr. Kelver, people in--in our\r\nposition always do. If it had been otherwise, if--if everything had been\r\nproper, then of course we should have loved each other. As it is, it has\r\nbeen a cat and dog existence. Hasn't it been a cat and dog existence,\r\nWillie?”\r\n\r\n“It's been just hell upon earth,” murmured the O'Kelly, with his eyes\r\nfixed gloomily upon the fire-stove ornament. Deadly in earnest though\r\nthey both were, I could not repress a laugh, their excellent intention\r\nwas so obvious. The Signora burst into tears.\r\n\r\n“He doesn't believe us,” she wailed.\r\n\r\n“Me dear,” replied the O'Kelly, throwing up his part with promptness and\r\nsatisfaction, “how could ye expect it? How could he believe that any man\r\ncould look at ye and hate ye?”\r\n\r\n“It's all my fault,” cried the little woman; “I am such a wicked\r\ncreature. I cannot even be miserable when I am doing wrong. A decent\r\nwoman in my place would have been wretched and unhappy, and made\r\neverybody about her wretched and unhappy, and so have set a good example\r\nand have been a warning. I don't seem to have any conscience, and I do\r\ntry.” The poor little lady was sobbing her heart out.\r\n\r\nWhen not shy I could be sensible, and of the O'Kelly and the Signora one\r\ncould be no more shy than of a pair of robin redbreasts. Besides, I was\r\nreally fond of them; they had been very good to me.\r\n\r\n“Dear Miss Beltoni,” I answered, “I am going to take warning by you\r\nboth.”\r\n\r\nShe pressed my hand. “Oh, do, please do,” she murmured. “We really have\r\nbeen miserable--now and then.”\r\n\r\n“I am never going to be content,” I assured her, “until I find a lady\r\nas charming and as amiable as you, and if ever I get her I'll take good\r\ncare never to run any risk of losing her.”\r\n\r\nIt sounded well and pleased us all. The O'Kelly shook me warmly by the\r\nhand, and this time spoke his real feelings.\r\n\r\n“Me boy,” he said, “all women are good--for somebody. But the woman that\r\nis good for yerself is better for ye than a better woman who's the best\r\nfor somebody else. Ye understand?”\r\n\r\nI said I did.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock precisely Mrs. Peedles arrived--as Flora MacDonald, in\r\ngreen velvet jacket and twelve to fifteen inches of plaid stocking. As\r\na topic fitting the occasion we discussed the absent Mr. Peedles and the\r\nsubject of deserted wives in general.\r\n\r\n“A fine-looking man,” allowed Mrs. Peedles, “but weak--weak as water.”\r\n\r\nThe Signora agreed that unfortunately there did exist such men: 'twas\r\npitiful but true.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” continued Mrs. Peedles, “she wasn't even a lady.”\r\n\r\nThe Signora expressed astonishment at the deterioration in Mr. Peedles'\r\ntaste thus implied.\r\n\r\n“I won't go so far as to say we never had a difference,” continued Mrs.\r\nPeedles, whose object appeared to be an impartial statement of the whole", "--weak as water.”\r\n\r\nThe Signora agreed that unfortunately there did exist such men: 'twas\r\npitiful but true.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” continued Mrs. Peedles, “she wasn't even a lady.”\r\n\r\nThe Signora expressed astonishment at the deterioration in Mr. Peedles'\r\ntaste thus implied.\r\n\r\n“I won't go so far as to say we never had a difference,” continued Mrs.\r\nPeedles, whose object appeared to be an impartial statement of the whole\r\ncase. “There may have been incompatability of temperament, as they say.\r\nMyself, I have always been of a playful disposition--frivolous, some\r\nmight call me.”\r\n\r\nThe Signora protested; the O'Kelly declined to listen to such aspersion\r\non her character even from Mrs. Peedles herself.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peedles, thus corrected, allowed that maybe frivolous was too\r\nsweeping an accusation: say sportive.\r\n\r\n“But a good wife to him I always was,” asserted Mrs. Peedles, with a\r\nfine sense of justice; “never flighty, like some of them. I challenge\r\nany one to accuse me of having been flighty.”\r\n\r\nWe felt we should not believe any one who did, and told her so.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peedles, drawing her chair closer to the Signora, assumed a\r\nconfidential attitude. “If they want to go, let 'em go, I always say,”\r\n she whispered loudly into the Signora's ear. “Ten to one they'll find\r\nthey've only jumped out of the frying-pan into the fire. One can always\r\ncomfort oneself with that.”\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be confusion in the mind of Mrs. Peedles. Her virtuous\r\nsympathies, I gathered, were with the Signora. Mr. O'Kelly's return\r\nto Mrs. O'Kelly evidently manifested itself in the light of a shameful\r\ndesertion. Having regard to the fact, patent to all who knew him, that\r\nthe poor fellow was sacrificing every inclination to stern sense of\r\nduty, such view of the matter was rough on him. But philosophers from\r\nall ages have agreed that our good deeds are the whips with which Fate\r\npunishes us for our bad.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” continued Mrs. Peedles, “when Mr. Peedles left me I thought\r\nthat I should never smile again. Yet here you see me laughing away\r\nthrough life, just as ever. You'll get over it all right.” And Mrs.\r\nPeedles wiped away her tears and smiled upon the Signora; upon which the\r\nSignora commenced to cry again.\r\n\r\nHappily, timely diversion was made at this point by the bursting into\r\nthe room of Jarman, who upon perceiving Mrs. Peedles, at once gave vent\r\nto a hoot, supposed to be expressive of Scottish joy, and without a\r\nmoment's hesitation commenced to dance a reel.\r\n\r\nMy neighbours of the first floor knocked at the door a little while\r\nafterwards; and genteelly late arrived Miss Rosina Sellars, coldly\r\ngleaming in a decollete but awe-inspiring costume of mingled black\r\nand scarlet, out of which her fair, if fleshy, neck and arms shone\r\nluxuriant.\r\n\r\nWe did not go into supper; instead, supper came into us from the\r\nrestaurant at the corner of the Blackfriars Road. I cannot say that at\r\nfirst it was a festive meal. The O'Kelly and the Signora made effort,\r\nas in duty bound, to be cheerful, but for awhile were somewhat\r\nunsuccessful. The third floor front wasted no time in speech, but ate\r\nand drank copiously. Miss Sellars, retaining her gloves--which was\r\nperhaps wise, her hands being her weak point--signalled me out, much to\r\nmy embarrassment, as the recipient of her most polite conversation. Mrs.\r\nPeedles became reminiscent of parties generally. Seeing that most of\r\nMrs. Peedles' former friends and acquaintances were either dead or in\r\nmore or less trouble, her efforts did not tend to enliven the table. One\r\ngathering, of which the present strangely reminded her, was a funeral,\r\nchiefly remarkable from discovery of the romantic fact, late in the\r\nproceedings, that the gentleman in whose honour the whole affair had\r\nbeen organised was not dead at all; but instead, having taken advantage\r\nof an error arising out of a railway accident, was at the moment eloping\r\nwith the wife of his own chief mourner. As Mrs. Peedles explained,\r\nand as one could well credit, it had been an awkward position for all\r\npresent. Nobody had quite known whether to feel glad or sorry--with the\r\nexception of the chief mourner, upon whose personal undertaking that the\r\ncompany might regard the ceremony as merely postponed, festivities came\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\nOur prop and stay from a convivial point of view was Jarman. As\r\na delicate attention to Mrs. Peedles and her costume he sunk\r\nhis nationality and became for the evening, according to his own\r\ndeclaration, “a braw laddie.” With her--his “sonsie lassie,” so he\r\ntermed her--he flirted in the broadest, if not purest, Scotch. The\r\nO'Kelly for him became “the Laird;” the third floor “Jamie o' the Ilk;”\r\n Miss Sellars, “the bonnie wee rose;” myself, “the chiel.” Periods of\r\nsilence were dispersed by suggestions that we should “hoot awa',” Jarman\r\nhimself setting us the example.\r\n\r\nWith the clearance away of the eatables, making room for the production\r\nof a more varied supply of bottles, matters began to mend. Mrs. Peedles\r\nbecame more arch, Jarman's Scotch more striking and extensive, the\r\nLady 'Ortensia's remarks less depressingly genteel, her aitches less\r\naccentuated.\r\n\r\nJarman rose to propose the health of the O'Kelly, coupled with that of\r\nthe Signora. To the O'Kelly, in a burst of generosity, Jarman promised\r\nour united patronage. To Jarman it appeared that by employing the\r\nO'Kelly to defend us whenever we got into trouble with the police, and\r\nby recommending him to our friends, a steady income should be assured to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe O'Kelly replied feelingly to the effect that Nelson Square,\r\nBlackfriars, would ever remain engraved upon his memory as the fairest\r\nand brightest spot on earth. Personally, nothing would have given him\r\ngreater pleasure than to die among the dear friends who now surrounded\r\nhim. But there was such a thing as duty, and he and the Signora had come\r\nto the conclusion that true happiness could only be obtained by acting\r\naccording to one's conscience, even if it made one miserable.\r\n\r\nJarman, warming to his work, then proposed the health of Mrs. Peedles,\r\nas true-hearted and hard-breathing a lady as ever it had been his\r\nprivilege to know. Her talent for cheery conversation was familiar to us\r\nall, upon it he need not enlarge; all he would say was that personally\r\nnever did she go out of his room without leaving him more cheerful than\r\nwhen she entered it.\r\n\r\nAfter that--I forget in what--we drank the health of the Lady 'Ortensia.\r\nPersons there were--Jarman would not attempt to disguise the fact--who\r\ncomplained that the Lady 'Ortensia was too distant, “too stand-offish.”\r\n With such complaint he himself had no sympathy; but tastes differed. If\r\nthe Lady 'Ortensia were inclined to be exclusive, who should blame her?\r\nEverybody knew their own business best. For use in a second floor front\r\nhe could not honestly recommend the Lady 'Ortensia; it would not be\r\ngiving her a fair chance, and it would not be giving the second floor a\r\nfair chance. But for any gentleman fitting up marble halls, for any one\r\non the lookout for a really “toney article,” Jarman would say: Inquire\r\nfor Miss Rosina Sellars, and see that you get her.\r\n\r\nThere followed my turn. There had been literary chaps in the past,\r\nJarman admitted so much. Against them he had nothing to say. They had no\r\ndoubt done their best. But the gentleman whose health Jarman wished the\r\ncompany now to drink had this advantage over them: that they were\r\ndead, and", "on the lookout for a really “toney article,” Jarman would say: Inquire\r\nfor Miss Rosina Sellars, and see that you get her.\r\n\r\nThere followed my turn.

But the gentleman whose health Jarman wished the\r\ncompany now to drink had this advantage over them: that they were\r\ndead, and he wasn't. Some of this gentleman's work Jarman had read--in\r\nmanuscript; but that was a distinction purely temporary. He, Jarman,\r\nclaimed to be no judge of literature, but this he could and would say,\r\nit took a good deal to make him miserable, yet this the literary efforts\r\nof Mr. Kelver invariably accomplished.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peedles, speaking without rising, from personal observation in the\r\ndaytime--which she hoped would not be deemed a liberty; literature, even\r\nin manuscript, being, so to speak, public property--found herself in a\r\nposition to confirm all that Mr. Jarman had remarked. Speaking as one\r\nnot entirely without authority on the subject of literature and the\r\ndrama, Mrs. Peedles could say that passages she had read had struck her\r\nas distinctly not half bad. Some of the love-scenes, in particular, had\r\nmade her to feel quite a girl again. How he had acquired such knowledge\r\nwas not for her to say. Cries of “Naughty!” from Jarman, and “Oh, Mr.\r\nKelver, I shall be quite afraid of you,” roguishly from Miss Sellars.\r\n\r\nThe O'Kelly, who, having abandoned his favourite champagne for less\r\nsobering liquor, had since supper-time become rapidly more cheerful,\r\nfelt sure there was a future before me. That he had not seen any of my\r\nwork, so he assured me, in no way lessened his opinion of it. One thing\r\nonly would he impress upon me: that the best work was the result of\r\nstrict attention to virtue. His advice to me was to marry young and be\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nMy persevering efforts of the last few months towards the acquisition of\r\nconvivial habits appeared this evening to be receiving their reward. The\r\nO'Kelly's sweet champagne I had drunk with less dislike than hitherto; a\r\nwhite, syrupy sort of stuff, out of a fat and artistic-looking bottle,\r\nI had found distinctly grateful to the palate. Dimly the quotation about\r\ntaking things at the flood, and so getting on quickly, floated through\r\nmy brain, coupled with another one about fortune favouring the bold. It\r\nhad seemed to me a good occasion to try for the second time in my life\r\na full flavoured cigar. I had selected with the caution of a connoisseur\r\none of mottled green complexion from the O'Kelly's largest box. And so\r\nfar all had gone well. An easy self-confidence, delightful by reason of\r\nits novelty, had replaced my customary shyness; a sense of lightness--of\r\npositive airiness, emanating from myself, pervaded all things. Tossing\r\noff another glass of the champagne, I rose to reply.\r\n\r\nModesty in my present mood would have been affectation. To such dear and\r\nwell-beloved friends I had no hesitation in admitting the truth, that I\r\nwas a clever fellow--a damned clever fellow. I knew it, they knew it, in\r\na short time everybody would know it. But they need not fear that in\r\nthe hour of my pride, when it arrived, I should prove ungrateful. Never\r\nshould I forget their kindness to me, a lonely young man, alone in a\r\nlonely--Here the pathos of my own situation overcame me; words seemed\r\nweak. “Jarman--” I meant, putting my hand upon his head, to have blessed\r\nhim for his goodness to me; but he being not exactly where he looked to\r\nbe, I just missed him, and sat down on the edge of my chair, which was a\r\nhard one. I had not intended this to be the end of my speech, by a long\r\none; but Jarman, whispering to me: “Ended at exactly the right moment;\r\nshows the born orator,” strong inclination to remain seated, now that I\r\nwas down seconding his counsel, and the company being clearly satisfied,\r\nI decided to leave things where they were.\r\n\r\nA delightful dreaminess was stealing over me. Everything and everybody\r\nappeared to be a long way off, but, whether because of this or in\r\nspite of it, exceedingly attractive. Never had I noticed the Signora\r\nso bewitching; in a motherly sort of way even the third floor front was\r\ngood to look upon; Mrs. Peedles I could almost have believed to be the\r\nreal Flora MacDonald sitting in front of me. But the vision of Miss\r\nRosina Sellars made literally my head to swim. Never before had I dared\r\nto cast upon female loveliness the satisfying gaze with which I now\r\nboldly regarded her every movement. Evidently she noticed it, for she\r\nturned away her eyes. I had heard that exceptionally strong-minded\r\npeople merely by concentrating their will could make other, ordinary\r\npeople, do just whatever they, the exceptionally strong-minded people,\r\nwished. I willed that Miss Rosina Sellars should turn her eyes again\r\ntowards me. Victory crowned my efforts. Evidently I was one of these\r\nexceptionally strong-minded persons. Slowly her eyes came round and met\r\nmine with a smile--a helpless, pathetic smile that said, so I read it:\r\n“You know no woman can resist you: be merciful!”\r\n\r\nInflamed by the brutal lust of conquest, I suppose I must have willed\r\nstill further, for the next thing I remember is sitting with Miss\r\nSellars on the sofa, holding her hand, the while the O'Kelly sang a\r\nsentimental ballad, only one line of which comes back to me: “For the\r\nangels must have told him, and he knows I love him now,” much stress\r\nupon the “now.” The others had their backs towards us. Miss Sellars,\r\nwith a look that pierced my heart, dropped her somewhat large head upon\r\nmy shoulder, leaving, as I observed the next day, a patch of powder on\r\nmy coat.\r\n\r\nMiss Sellars observed that one of the saddest things in the world was\r\nunrequited love.\r\n\r\nI replied gallantly, “Whateryou know about it?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you men, you men,” murmured Miss Sellars; “you're all alike.”\r\n\r\nThis suggested a personal aspersion on my character. “Not allus,” I\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\n“You don't know what love is,” said Miss Sellars. “You're not old\r\nenough.”\r\n\r\nThe O'Kelly had passed on to Sullivan's “Sweethearts,” then in its first\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\n     “Oh, love for a year--a week--a day!\r\n     But oh for the love that loves al-wa-ays!”\r\n\r\nMiss Sellars' languishing eyes were fixed upon me; Miss Sellars' red\r\nlips pouted and twitched; Miss Sellars' white bosom rose and fell.\r\nNever, so it seemed to me, had so large an amount of beauty been\r\nconcentrated in one being.\r\n\r\n“Yeserdo,” I said. “I love you.”\r\n\r\nI stooped to kiss the red lips, but something was in my way. It turned\r\nout to be a cold cigar. Miss Sellars thoughtfully removed it, and threw\r\nit away. Our lips met. Her large arms closed about my neck and held me\r\ntight.\r\n\r\n“Well, I'm sure!” came the voice of Mrs. Peedles, as from afar. “Nice\r\ngoings on!”\r\n\r\nI have vague remembrance of a somewhat heated discussion, in which\r\neverybody but myself appeared to be taking extreme interest--of Miss\r\nSellars in her most ladylike and chilling tones defending me against the\r\ncharge of “being no gentleman,” which Mrs. Peedles was explaining nobody\r\nhad said I wasn't. The argument seemed to be of the circular order. No\r\ngentleman had ever kissed Miss Sellars who had not every right to do so,\r\nnor ever would. To kiss Miss Sellars without such right was to declare\r\noneself no gentleman. Miss Sellars appealed to me to clear my character\r\nfrom the aspersion of being no gentleman.", " defending me against the\r\ncharge of “being no gentleman,” which Mrs. Peedles was explaining nobody\r\nhad said I wasn't.

To kiss Miss Sellars without such right was to declare\r\noneself no gentleman. Miss Sellars appealed to me to clear my character\r\nfrom the aspersion of being no gentleman. I was trying to understand\r\nthe situation, when Jarman, seizing me somewhat roughly by the arm,\r\nsuggested my going to bed. Miss Sellars, seizing my other arm, suggested\r\nmy refusing to go to bed. So far I was with Miss Sellars. I didn't want\r\nto go to bed, and said so. My desire to sit up longer was proof positive\r\nto Miss Sellars that I was a gentleman, but to no one else. The argument\r\nshifted, the question being now as to whether Miss Sellars were a lady.\r\nTo prove the point it was, according to Miss Sellars, necessary that\r\nI should repeat I loved her. I did repeat it, adding, with faint\r\nremembrance of my own fiction, that if a life's devotion was likely to\r\nbe of the slightest further proof, my heart's blood was at her\r\nservice. This cleared the air, Mrs. Peedles observing that under such\r\ncircumstances it only remained for her to withdraw everything she had\r\nsaid; to which Miss Sellars replied graciously that she had always known\r\nMrs. Peedles to be a good sort at the bottom.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, gaiety was gone from among us, and for this, in some way\r\nI could not understand, I appeared to be responsible. Jarman was\r\ndistinctly sulky. The O'Kelly, suddenly thinking of the time, went to\r\nthe door and discovered that the two cabs were waiting. The third floor\r\nrecollected that work had to be finished. I myself felt sleepy.\r\n\r\nOur host and hostess departed; Jarman again suggested bed, and this\r\ntime I agreed with him. After a slight misunderstanding with the door, I\r\nfound myself upon the stairs. I had never noticed before that they\r\nwere quite perpendicular. Adapting myself to the changed conditions, I\r\nclimbed them with the help of my hands. I accomplished the last flight\r\nsomewhat quickly, and feeling tired, sat down the moment I was within\r\nmy own room. Jarman knocked at the door. I told him to come in; but he\r\ndidn't. It occurred to me that the reason was I was sitting on the floor\r\nwith my back against the door. The discovery amused me exceedingly and\r\nI laughed; and Jarman, baffled, descended to his own floor. I found\r\ngetting into bed a difficulty, owing to the strange behaviour of the\r\nroom. It spun round and round. Now the bed was just in front of me, now\r\nit was behind me. I managed at last to catch it before it could get past\r\nme, and holding on by the ironwork, frustrated its efforts to throw me\r\nout again on to the floor.\r\n\r\nBut it was some time before I went to sleep, and over my intervening\r\nexperiences I draw a veil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nGOOD FRIENDS SHOW PAUL THE ROAD TO FREEDOM. BUT BEFORE SETTING OUT, HE\r\nWILL GO A-VISITING.\r\n\r\nThe sun was streaming into my window when I woke in the morning. I sat\r\nup and listened. The roar of the streets told me plainly that the day\r\nhad begun without me. I reached out my hand for my watch; it was not in\r\nits usual place upon the rickety dressing-table. I raised myself still\r\nhigher and looked about me. My clothes lay scattered on the floor. One\r\nboot, in solitary state, occupied the chair by the fireplace; the other\r\nI could not see anywhere.\r\n\r\nDuring the night my head appeared to have grown considerably. I\r\nwondered idly for the moment whether I had not made a mistake and put\r\non Minikin's; if so, I should be glad to exchange back for my own.\r\nThis thing I had got was a top-heavy affair, and was aching most\r\nconfoundedly.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the recollection of the previous night rushed at me and shook\r\nme awake. From a neighbouring steeple rang chimes: I counted with care.\r\nEleven o'clock. I sprang out of bed, and at once sat down upon the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nI remembered how, holding on to the bed, I had felt the room waltzing\r\nwildly round and round. It had not quite steadied itself even yet. It\r\nwas still rotating, not whirling now, but staggering feebly, as\r\nthough worn out by its all-night orgie. Creeping to the wash-stand, I\r\nsucceeded, after one or two false plunges, in getting my head inside\r\nthe basin. Then, drawing on my trousers with difficulty and reaching\r\nthe easy-chair, I sat down and reviewed matters so far as I was able,\r\ncommencing from the present and working back towards the past.\r\n\r\nI was feeling very ill. That was quite clear. Something had disagreed\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\n“That strong cigar,” I whispered feebly to myself; “I ought never to\r\nhave ventured upon it. And then the little room with all those people\r\nin it. Besides, I have been working very hard. I must really take more\r\nexercise.”\r\n\r\nIt gave me some satisfaction to observe that, shuffling and cowardly\r\nthough I might be, I was not a person easily bamboozled.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” I told myself brutally; “don't try to deceive me. You were\r\ndrunk.”\r\n\r\n“Not drunk,” I pleaded; “don't say drunk; it is such a coarse\r\nexpression. Some people cannot stand sweet champagne, so I have heard.\r\nIt affected my liver. Do please make it a question of liver.”\r\n\r\n“Drunk,” I persisted unrelentingly, “hopelessly, vulgarly drunk--drunk\r\nas any 'Arry after a Bank Holiday.”\r\n\r\n“It is the first time,” I murmured.\r\n\r\n“It was your first opportunity,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“Never again,” I promised.\r\n\r\n“The stock phrase,” I returned.\r\n\r\n“How old are you?”\r\n\r\n“Nineteen.”\r\n\r\n“So you have not even the excuse of youth. How do you know that it will\r\nnot grow upon you; that, having thus commenced a downward career, you\r\nwill not sink lower and lower, and so end by becoming a confirmed sot?”\r\n\r\nMy heavy head dropped into my hands, and I groaned. Many a temperance\r\ntale perused on Sunday afternoons came back to me. Imaginative in all\r\ndirections, I watched myself hastening toward a drunkard's grave, now\r\nheroically struggling against temptation, now weakly yielding, the\r\ncraving growing upon me. In the misty air about me I saw my father's\r\nwhite face, my mother's sad eyes. I thought of Barbara, of the scorn\r\nthat could quiver round that bewitching mouth; of Hal, with his\r\ntremendous contempt for all forms of weakness. Shame of the present and\r\nterror of the future between them racked my mind.\r\n\r\n“It shall be never again!” I cried aloud. “By God, it shall!” (At\r\nnineteen one is apt to be vehement.) “I will leave this house at once,”\r\n I continued to myself aloud; “I will get away from its unwholesome\r\natmosphere. I will wipe it out of my mind, and all connected with it. I\r\nwill make a fresh start. I will--”\r\n\r\nSomething I had been dimly conscious of at the back of my brain came\r\nforward and stood before me: the flabby figure of Miss Rosina Sellars.\r\nWhat was she doing here? What right had she to step between me and my\r\nregeneration?\r\n\r\n“The right of your affianced bride,” my other half explained, with a\r\ngrim smile to myself.\r\n\r\n“Did I really go so far as that?”\r\n\r\n“We will not go into details,” I replied; “I do not wish to dwell upon\r\nthem. That was the result.”\r\n\r\n“I was--I was not quite myself at the time. I did not know what I was\r\ndoing.”\r\n\r\n“As a rule, we don't when we do foolish things; but we have to abide by\r\nthe consequences, all the same. Unfortunately", " half explained, with a\r\ngrim smile to myself.\r\n\r\n“Did I really go so far as that?”\r\n\r\n“We will not go into details,” I replied; “I do not wish to dwell upon\r\nthem. That was the result.”\r\n\r\n“I was--I was not quite myself at the time. I did not know what I was\r\ndoing.”\r\n\r\n“As a rule, we don't when we do foolish things; but we have to abide by\r\nthe consequences, all the same. Unfortunately, it happened to be in the\r\npresence of witnesses, and she is not the sort of lady to be easily got\r\nrid of. You will marry her and settle down with her in two small rooms.\r\nHer people will be your people. You will come to know them better before\r\nmany days are passed. Among them she is regarded as 'the lady,' from\r\nwhich you can judge of them. A nice commencement of your career, is it\r\nnot, my ambitious young friend? A nice mess you have made of it!”\r\n\r\n“What am I to do?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, I don't know,” I answered.\r\n\r\nI passed a wretched day. Ashamed to face Mrs. Peedles or even the\r\nslavey, I kept to my room, with the door locked. At dusk, feeling a\r\nlittle better--or, rather, less bad, I stole out and indulged in a\r\nsimple meal, consisting of tea without sugar and a kippered herring, at\r\na neighbouring coffee-house. Another gentleman, taking his seat opposite\r\nto me and ordering hot buttered toast, I left hastily.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock in the evening Minikin called round from the office to\r\nknow what had happened. Seeking help from shame, I confessed to him the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n“Thought as much,” he answered. “Seems to have been an A1 from the look\r\nof you.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad it has happened, now it is over,” I said to him. “It will be\r\na lesson I shall never forget.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” said Minikin. “Nothing like a fair and square drunk for making\r\nyou feel real good; better than a sermon.”\r\n\r\nIn my trouble I felt the need of advice; and Minikin, though my junior,\r\nwas, I knew, far more experienced in worldly affairs than I was.\r\n\r\n“That's not the worst,” I confided to him. “What do you think I've\r\ndone?”\r\n\r\n“Killed a policeman?” suggested Minikin.\r\n\r\n“Got myself engaged.”\r\n\r\n“No one like you quiet fellows for going it when you do begin,”\r\n commented Minikin. “Nice girl?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know,” I answered. “I only know I don't want her. How can I get\r\nout of it?”\r\n\r\nMinikin removed his left eye and commenced to polish it upon his\r\nhandkerchief, a habit he had when in doubt. From looking into it he\r\nappeared to derive inspiration.\r\n\r\n“Take-her-own-part sort of a girl?”\r\n\r\nI intimated that he had diagnosed Miss Rosina Sellars correctly.\r\n\r\n“Know how much you're earning?”\r\n\r\n“She knows I live up here in this attic and do my own cooking,” I\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nMinikin glanced round the room. “Must be fond of you.”\r\n\r\n“She thinks I'm clever,” I explained, “and that I shall make my way.\r\n\r\n“And she's willing to wait?”\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“Well, I should let her wait,” replied Minikin, replacing his eye.\r\n“There's plenty of time before you.”\r\n\r\n“But she's a barmaid, and she'll expect me to walk with her, to take her\r\nout on Sundays, to go and see her friends. I can't do it. Besides, she's\r\nright: I mean to get on. Then she'll stick to me. It's awful!”\r\n\r\n“How did it happen?” asked Minikin.\r\n\r\n“I don't know,” I replied. “I didn't know I had done it till it was\r\nover.”\r\n\r\n“Anybody present?”\r\n\r\n“Half-a-dozen of them,” I groaned.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Jarman entered; he never troubled to knock\r\nanywhere. In place of his usual noisy greeting, he crossed in silence\r\nand shook me gravely by the hand.\r\n\r\n“Friend of yours?” he asked, indicating Minikin.\r\n\r\nI introduced them to each other.\r\n\r\n“Proud to meet you,” said Jarman.\r\n\r\n“Glad to hear it,” said Minikin. “Don't look as if you'd got much else\r\nto be stuck up about.”\r\n\r\n“Don't mind him,” I explained to Jarman. “He was born like it.”\r\n\r\n“Wonderful gift” replied Jarman. “D'ye know what I should do if I 'ad\r\nit?” He did not wait for Minikin's reply. “'Ire myself out to break up\r\nevening parties. Ever thought of it seriously?”\r\n\r\nMinikin replied that he would give the idea consideration.\r\n\r\n“Make your fortune going round the suburbs,” assured him Jarman. “Pity\r\nyou weren't 'ere last night,” he continued; “might 'ave saved our young\r\nfriend 'ere a deal of trouble. Has 'e told you the news?”\r\n\r\nI explained that I had already put Minikin in possession of all the\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n“Now you've got a good, steady eye,” said Jarman, upon whom Minikin,\r\naccording to his manner, had fixed his glass orb; “'ow d'ye think 'e is\r\nlooking?”\r\n\r\n“As well as can be expected under the circumstances, don't you think?”\r\n answered Minikin.\r\n\r\n“Does 'e know the circumstances? Has 'e seen the girl?” asked Jarman.\r\n\r\nI replied he had not as yet enjoyed that privilege. “Then 'e don't know\r\nthe worst,” said Jarman. “A hundred and sixty pounds of 'er, and still\r\ngrowing! Bit of a load for 'im, ain't it?”\r\n\r\n“Some of 'em do have luck,” was Minikin's rejoinder. Jarman\r\nleant forward and took further stock for a few seconds of his new\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\n“That's a fine 'ead of yours,” he remarked; “all your own? No offence,”\r\n continued Jarman, without giving Minikin time for repartee. “I was\r\nmerely thinking there must be room for a lot of sense in it. Now, what\r\ndo you, as a practical man, advise 'im: dose of poison, or Waterloo\r\nBridge and a brick?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose there's no doubt,” I interjected, “that we are actually\r\nengaged?”\r\n\r\n“Not a blooming shadow,” assured me Jarman, cheerfully, “so far as she's\r\nconcerned.”\r\n\r\n“I shall tell her plainly,” I explained, “that I was drunk at the time.”\r\n\r\n“And 'ow are you going to convince 'er of it?” asked Jarman. “You think\r\nyour telling 'er you loved 'er proves it. So it would to anybody else,\r\nbut not to 'er. You can't expect it. Besides, if every girl is going to\r\ngive up 'er catch just because the fellow 'adn't all 'is wits about 'im\r\nat the time--well, what do you think?” He appealed to Minikin.\r\n\r\nTo Minikin it appeared that if such contention were allowed girls might\r\nas well shut up shop.\r\n\r\nJarman, who now that he had “got even” with Minikin, was more friendly\r\ndisposed towards that young man, drew his chair closer to him and\r\nentered upon a private and confidential argument, from which I appeared\r\nto be entirely excluded.\r\n\r\n“You see,” explained Jarman, “this ain't an ordinary case. This chap's\r\ngoing to be the future Poet Laureate. Now, when the Prince of Wales\r\ninvites him to dine at Marlborough 'ouse, 'e don't want to go there\r\ntacked on to a girl that carries aitches with her in a bag, and don't\r\nknow which end of the spoon out of which to drink 'er soup.”\r\n\r\n“It makes a difference, of course,” agreed Minikin.\r\n\r\n“What we've got to do,” said Jarman, “is to get 'im out of it. And upon\r\nmy sivvy, blessed if I see 'ow to do it!”\r\n\r\n“She fancies him?” asked Minikin.\r\n\r\n“What she fancies,” explained Jarman, “is that nature intended '", " bag, and don't\r\nknow which end of the spoon out of which to drink 'er soup.”\r\n\r\n“It makes a difference, of course,” agreed Minikin.\r\n\r\n“What we've got to do,” said Jarman, “is to get 'im out of it. And upon\r\nmy sivvy, blessed if I see 'ow to do it!”\r\n\r\n“She fancies him?” asked Minikin.\r\n\r\n“What she fancies,” explained Jarman, “is that nature intended 'er to be\r\na lady. And it's no good pointing out to 'er the mistake she's making,\r\nbecause she ain't got sense enough to see it.”\r\n\r\n“No good talking straight to her,” suggested Minikin, “telling her that\r\nit can never be?”\r\n\r\n“That's our difficulty,” replied Jarman; “it can be. This chap”--I\r\nlistened as might a prisoner in the dock to the argument of counsel,\r\ninterested but impotent--“don't know enough to come in out of the rain,\r\nas the saying is. 'E's just the sort of chap this sort of thing does\r\n'appen to.”\r\n\r\n“But he don't want her,” urged Minikin. “He says he don't want her.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, to you and me,” answered Jarman; “and of course 'e don't. I'm\r\nnot saying 'e's a natural born idiot. But let 'er come along and do\r\na snivel--tell 'im that 'e's breaking 'er 'eart, and appeal to 'im to\r\nbe'ave as a gentleman, and all that sort of thing, and what do you think\r\nwill be the result?”\r\n\r\nMinikin agreed that the problem presented difficulties.\r\n\r\n“Of course, if 'twas you or me, we should just tell 'er to put 'erself\r\naway somewhere where the moth couldn't get at 'er and wait till we sent\r\nround for 'er; and there'd be an end of the matter. But with 'im it's\r\ndifferent.”\r\n\r\n“He is a bit of a soft,” agreed Minikin.\r\n\r\n“'Tain't 'is fault,” explained Jarman; “'twas the way 'e was brought up.\r\n'E fancies girls are the sort of things one sees in plays, going about\r\nsaying 'Un'and me!' 'Let me pass!' Maybe some of 'em are, but this ain't\r\none of 'em.”\r\n\r\n“How did it happen?” asked Minikin.\r\n\r\n“'Ow does it 'appen nine times out of ten?” returned Jarman. “'E was a\r\nbit misty, and she was wide awake. 'E gets a bit spoony, and--well, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“Artful things, girls,” commented Minikin.\r\n\r\n“Can't blame 'em,” returned Jarman, with generosity; “it's their\r\nbusiness. Got to dispose of themselves somehow. Oughtn't to be binding\r\nwithout a written order dated the next morning; that'd make it all\r\nright.”\r\n\r\n“Couldn't prove a prior engagement?” suggested Minikin.\r\n\r\n“She'd want to see the girl first before she'd believe it--only\r\nnatural,” returned Jarman.\r\n\r\n“Couldn't get a girl?” urged Minikin.\r\n\r\n“Who could you trust?” asked the cautious Jarman. “Besides, there ain't\r\ntime. She's letting 'im rest to-day; to-morrow evening she'll be down on\r\n'im.”\r\n\r\n“Don't see anything for it,” said Minikin, “but for him to do a bunk.”\r\n\r\n“Not a bad idea that,” mused Jarman; “only where's 'e to bunk to?”\r\n\r\n“Needn't go far,” said Minikin.\r\n\r\n“She'd find 'im out and follow 'im,” said Jarman. “She can look after\r\nherself, mind you. Don't you go doing 'er any injustice.”\r\n\r\n“He could change his name,” suggested Minikin.\r\n\r\n“'Ow could 'e get a crib?” asked Jarman; “no character, no references.”\r\n\r\n“I've got it,” cried Jarman, starting up; “the stage!”\r\n\r\n“Can he act?” asked Minikin.\r\n\r\n“Can do anything,” retorted my supporter, “that don't want too much\r\nsense. That's 'is sanctuary, the stage. No questions asked, no character\r\nwanted. Lord! why didn't I think of it before?”\r\n\r\n“Wants a bit of getting on to, doesn't it?” suggested Minikin.\r\n\r\n“Depends upon where you want to get,” replied Jarman. For the first\r\ntime since the commencement of the discussion he turned to me. “Can you\r\nsing?” he asked me.\r\n\r\nI replied that I could a little, though I had never done so in public.\r\n\r\n“Sing something now,” demanded Jarman; “let's 'ear you. Wait a minute!”\r\n he cried.\r\n\r\nHe slipped out of the room. I heard him pause upon the landing below\r\nand knock at the door of the fair Rosina's room. The next minute he\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n“It's all right,” he explained; “she's not in yet. Now, sing for all\r\nyou're worth. Remember, it's for life and freedom.”\r\n\r\nI sang “Sally in Our Alley,” not with much spirit, I am inclined to\r\nthink. With every mention of the lady's name there rose before me the\r\nabundant form and features of my _fiancee_, which checked the feeling\r\nthat should have trembled through my voice. But Jarman, though not\r\nenthusiastic, was content.\r\n\r\n“It isn't what I call a grand opera voice,” he commented, “but it ought\r\nto do all right for a chorus where economy is the chief point to be\r\nconsidered. Now, I'll tell you what to do. You go to-morrow straight to\r\nthe O'Kelly, and put the whole thing before 'im. 'E's a good sort; 'e'll\r\ntouch you up a bit, and maybe give you a few introductions. Lucky for\r\nyou, this is just the right time. There's one or two things comin'\r\non, and if Fate ain't dead against you, you'll lose your amorita, or\r\nwhatever it's called, and not find 'er again till it's too late.”\r\n\r\nI was not in the mood that evening to feel hopeful about anything; but I\r\nthanked both of them for their kind intentions and promised to think\r\nthe suggestion over on the morrow, when, as it was generally agreed, I\r\nshould be in a more fitting state to bring cool judgment to bear upon\r\nthe subject; and they rose to take their departure.\r\n\r\nLeaving Minikin to descend alone, Jarman returned the next minute.\r\n“Consols are down a bit this week,” he whispered, with the door in his\r\nhand. “If you want a little of the ready to carry you through, don't\r\ngo sellin' out. I can manage a few pounds. Suck a couple of lemons and\r\nyou'll be all right in the morning. So long.”\r\n\r\nI followed his advice regarding the lemons, and finding it correct, went\r\nto the office next morning as usual. Lott & Co., in consideration of my\r\nagreeing to a deduction of two shillings on the week's salary, allowed\r\nhimself to overlook the matter. I had intended acting on Jarman's\r\nadvice, to call upon the O'Kelly at his address of respectability in\r\nHampstead that evening, and had posted him a note saying I was coming.\r\nBefore leaving the office, however, I received a reply to the effect\r\nthat he would be out that evening, and asking me to make it the\r\nfollowing Friday instead. Disappointed, I returned to my lodgings in a\r\ndepressed state of mind. Jarman 's scheme, which had appeared hopeful\r\nand even attractive during the daytime, now loomed shadowy and\r\nimpossible before me. The emptiness of the first floor parlour as\r\nI passed its open door struck a chill upon me, reminding me of the\r\ndisappearance of a friend to whom, in spite of moral disapproval, I had\r\nduring these last few months become attached. Unable to work, the old\r\npain of loneliness returned upon me. I sat for awhile in the darkness,\r\nlistening to the scratching of the pen of my neighbour, the old\r\nlaw-writer, and the sense of despair that its sound always communicated\r\nto me encompassed me", " as\r\nI passed its open door struck a chill upon me, reminding me of the\r\ndisappearance of a friend to whom, in spite of moral disapproval, I had\r\nduring these last few months become attached. Unable to work, the old\r\npain of loneliness returned upon me. I sat for awhile in the darkness,\r\nlistening to the scratching of the pen of my neighbour, the old\r\nlaw-writer, and the sense of despair that its sound always communicated\r\nto me encompassed me about this evening with heavier weight than usual.\r\n\r\nAfter all, was not the sympathy of the Lady 'Ortensia, stimulated for\r\npersonal purposes though it might be, better than nothing? At least,\r\nhere was some living creature to whom I belonged, to whom my existence\r\nor nonexistence was of interest, who, if only for her own sake, was\r\nbound to share my hopes, my fears.\r\n\r\nIt was in this mood that I heard a slight tap at the door. In the dim\r\npassage stood the small slavey, holding out a note. I took it, and\r\nreturning, lighted my candle. The envelope was pink and scented. It was\r\naddressed, in handwriting not so bad as I had expected, to “Paul Kelver,\r\nEsquire.” I opened it and read:\r\n\r\n“Dr mr. Paul--I herd as how you was took hill hafter the party. I feer\r\nyou are not strong. You must not work so hard or you will be hill and\r\nthen I shall be very cros with you. I hop you are well now. If so I am\r\ngoing for a wark and you may come with me if you are good. With much\r\nlove. From your affechonat ROSIE.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of the spelling, a curious, tingling sensation stole over me\r\nas I read this my first love-letter. A faint mist swam before my eyes.\r\nThrough it, glorified and softened, I saw the face of my betrothed,\r\npasty yet alluring, her large white fleshy arms stretched out invitingly\r\ntoward me. Moved by a sudden hot haste that seized me, I dressed myself\r\nwith trembling hands; I appeared to be anxious to act without giving\r\nmyself time for thought. Complete, with a colour in my cheeks unusual to\r\nthem, and a burning in my eyes, I descended and knocked with a nervous\r\nhand at the door of the second floor back.\r\n\r\n“Who's that?” came in answer Miss Sellars' sharp tones.\r\n\r\n“It is I--Paul.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, wait a minute, dear.” The tone was sweeter. There followed the\r\nsound of scurried footsteps, a rustling of clothes, a banging of\r\ndrawers, a few moments' dead silence, and then:\r\n\r\n“You can come in now, dear.”\r\n\r\nI entered. It was a small, untidy room, smelling of smoky lamp; but all\r\nI saw distinctly at the moment was Miss Sellars with her arms above her\r\nhead, pinning her hat upon her straw-coloured hair.\r\n\r\nWith the sight of her before me in the flesh, my feelings underwent a\r\nsudden revulsion. During the few minutes she had kept me waiting outside\r\nthe door I had suffered from an almost uncontrollable desire to turn the\r\nhandle and rush in. Now, had I acted on impulse, I should have run out.\r\nNot that she was an unpleasant-looking girl by any means; it was the\r\natmosphere of coarseness, of commonness, around her that repelled me.\r\nThe fastidiousness--finikinness; if you will--that would so often spoil\r\nmy rare chop, put before me by a waitress with dirty finger-nails,\r\nforced me to disregard the ample charms she no doubt did possess, to\r\nfasten my eyes exclusively upon her red, rough hands and the one or two\r\nwarts that grew thereon.\r\n\r\n“You're a very naughty boy,” told me Miss Sellars, finishing the\r\nfastening of her hat. “Why didn't you come in and see me in the\r\ndinner-_h_our? I've a great mind not to kiss you.”\r\n\r\nThe powder she had evidently dabbed on hastily was plainly visible upon\r\nher face; the round, soft arms were hidden beneath ill-fitting sleeves\r\nof some crapey material, the thought of which put my teeth on edge. I\r\nwished her intention had been stronger. Instead, relenting, she\r\noffered me her flowery cheek, which I saluted gingerly, the taste of it\r\nreminding me of certain pale, thin dough-cakes manufactured by the wife\r\nof our school porter and sold to us in playtime at four a penny, and\r\nwhich, having regard to their satisfying quality, had been popular with\r\nme in those days.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the kitchen stairs Miss Sellars paused and called down\r\nshrilly to Mrs. Peedles, who in course of time appeared, panting.\r\n\r\n“Oh, me and Mr. Kelver are going out for a short walk, Mrs. Peedles. I\r\nshan't want any supper. Good night.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, good night, my dear,” replied Mrs. Peedles. “Hope you'll enjoy\r\nyourselves. Is Mr. Kelver there?”\r\n\r\n“He's round the corner,” I heard Miss Sellars explain in a lower voice;\r\nand there followed a snigger.\r\n\r\n“He's a bit shy, ain't he?” suggested Mrs. Peedles in a whisper.\r\n\r\n“I've had enough of the other sort,” was Miss Sellars' answer in low\r\ntones.\r\n\r\n“Ah, well; it's the shy ones that come out the strongest after a\r\nbit--leastways, that's been my experience.”\r\n\r\n“He'll do all right. So long.”\r\n\r\nMiss Sellars, buttoning a burst glove, rejoined me.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you've never had a sweetheart before?” asked Miss Sellars, as\r\nwe turned into the Blackfriars Road.\r\n\r\nI admitted that this was my first experience.\r\n\r\n“I can't a-bear a flirty man,” explained Miss Sellars. “That's why I\r\ntook to you from the beginning. You was so quiet.”\r\n\r\nI began to wish that nature had bestowed upon me a noisier temperament.\r\n\r\n“Anybody could see you was a gentleman,” continued Miss Sellars. “Heaps\r\nand heaps of hoffers I've had--_h_undreds you might almost say. But what\r\nI've always told 'em is, 'I like you very much indeed as a friend, but\r\nI'm not going to marry any one but a gentleman.' Don't you think I was\r\nright?”\r\n\r\nI murmured it was only what I should have expected of her.\r\n\r\n“You may take my harm, if you like,” suggested Miss Sellars, as we\r\ncrossed St. George's Circus; and linked, we pursued our way along the\r\nKennington Park Road.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there was not much need for me to talk. Miss Sellars was\r\ncontent to supply most of the conversation herself, and all of it was\r\nabout herself.\r\n\r\nI learned that her instincts since childhood had been toward gentility.\r\nNor was this to be wondered at, seeing that her family--on her mother's\r\nside, at all events,--were connected distinctly with “the _h_ighest in\r\nthe land.” _Mesalliances_, however, are common in all communities, and\r\none of them, a particularly flagrant specimen--her “Mar” had, alas!\r\ncontracted, having married--what did I think? I should never guess--a\r\nwaiter! Miss Sellars, stopping in the act of crossing Newington Butts to\r\nshudder at the recollection of her female parent's shame, was nearly run\r\ndown by a tramcar.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Sellars did not appear to have “hit it off” together. Could\r\none wonder: Mrs. Sellars with an uncle on the Stock Exchange, and Mr.\r\nSellars with one on Peckham Rye? I gathered his calling to have been,\r\nchiefly, “three shies a penny.” Mrs. Sellars was now, however, happily\r\ndead; and if no other good thing had come out of the catastrophe, it had\r\ndetermined Miss Sellars to take warning by her mother's error and avoid\r\nconnection with the lowly born. She it was who, with my help, would lift\r\nthe family back again to its proper position in society.\r\n\r\n“It used to be a joke against me,” explained Miss Sellars, “heven when\r\nI was quite a child. I never could tolerate", " was now, however, happily\r\ndead; and if no other good thing had come out of the catastrophe, it had\r\ndetermined Miss Sellars to take warning by her mother's error and avoid\r\nconnection with the lowly born. She it was who, with my help, would lift\r\nthe family back again to its proper position in society.\r\n\r\n“It used to be a joke against me,” explained Miss Sellars, “heven when\r\nI was quite a child. I never could tolerate anything low. Why, one day\r\nwhen I was only seven years old, what do you think happened?”\r\n\r\nI confessed my inability to guess.\r\n\r\n“Well, I'll tell you,” said Miss Sellars; “it'll just show you. Uncle\r\nJoseph--that was father's uncle, you understand?”\r\n\r\nI assured Miss Sellars that the point was fixed in my mind.\r\n\r\n“Well, one day when he came to see us he takes a cocoanut out of his\r\npocket and offers it to me. 'Thank you,' I says; 'I don't heat cocoanuts\r\nthat have been shied at by just anybody and missed!' It made him so\r\nwild. After that,” explained Miss Sellars, “they used to call me at home\r\nthe Princess of Wales.”\r\n\r\nI murmured it was a pretty fancy.\r\n\r\n“Some people,” replied Miss Sellars, with a giggle, “says it fits me;\r\nbut, of course, that's only their nonsense.”\r\n\r\nNot knowing what to reply, I remained silent, which appeared to somewhat\r\ndisappoint Miss Sellars.\r\n\r\nOut of the Clapham Road we turned into a by-street of two-storeyed\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n“You'll come in and have a bit of supper?” suggested Miss Sellars.\r\n“Mar's quite hanxious to see you.”\r\n\r\nI found sufficient courage to say I was not feeling well, and would much\r\nrather return home.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but you must just come in for five minutes, dear. It'll look so\r\nfunny if you don't. I told 'em we was coming.”\r\n\r\n“I would really rather not,” I urged; “some other evening.” I felt\r\na presentiment, I confided to her, that on this particular evening I\r\nshould not shine to advantage.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you mustn't be so shy,” said Miss Sellars. “I don't like shy\r\nfellows--not too shy. That's silly.” And Miss Sellars took my arm with\r\na decided grip, making it clear to me that escape could be obtained only\r\nby an unseemly struggle in the street; not being prepared for which, I\r\nmeekly yielded.\r\n\r\nWe knocked at the door of one of the small houses, Miss Sellars\r\nretaining her hold upon me until it had been opened to us by a lank\r\nyoung man in his shirt-sleeves and closed behind us.\r\n\r\n“Don't gentlemen wear coats of a hevening nowadays?” asked Miss Sellars,\r\ntartly, of the lank young man. “New fashion just come in?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know what gentlemen wear in the evening or what they don't,”\r\n retorted the lank young man, who appeared to be in an aggressive mood.\r\n“If I can find one in this street, I'll ast him and let you know.”\r\n\r\n“Mother in the droaring-room?” enquired Miss Sellars, ignoring the\r\nretort.\r\n\r\n“They're all of 'em in the parlour, if that's what you mean,” returned\r\nthe lank young man, “the whole blooming shoot. If you stand up against\r\nthe wall and don't breathe, there'll just be room for you.”\r\n\r\nSweeping by the lank young man, Miss Sellars opened the parlour door,\r\nand towing me in behind her, shut it.\r\n\r\n“Well, Mar, here we are,” announced Miss Sellars. An enormously stout\r\nlady, ornamented with a cap that appeared to have been made out of a\r\nbandanna handkerchief, rose to greet us, thus revealing the fact\r\nthat she had been sitting upon an extremely small horsehair-covered\r\neasy-chair, the disproportion between the lady and her support being\r\nquite pathetic.\r\n\r\n“I am charmed, Mr.--”\r\n\r\n“Kelver,” supplied Miss Sellars.\r\n\r\n“Kelver, to make your ac-quain-tance,” recited Mrs. Sellars in the tone\r\nof one repeating a lesson.\r\n\r\nI bowed, and murmured that the honour was entirely mine.\r\n\r\n“Don't mention it,” replied Mrs. Sellars. “Pray be seated.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Sellars herself set the example by suddenly giving way and dropping\r\ndown into her chair, which thus again became invisible. It received her\r\nwith an agonised groan.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the insistence with which this article of furniture throughout\r\nthe evening called attention to its sufferings was really quite\r\ndistracting. With every breath that Mrs. Sellars took it moaned wearily.\r\nThere were moments when it literally shrieked. I could not have accepted\r\nMrs. Sellars' offer had I wished, there being no chair vacant and no\r\nroom for another. A young man with watery eyes, sitting just behind me\r\nbetween a fat young lady and a lean one, rose and suggested my taking\r\nhis place. Miss Sellars introduced me to him as her cousin Joseph\r\nsomething or other, and we shook hands.\r\n\r\nThe watery-eyed Joseph remarked that it had been a fine day between\r\nthe showers, and hoped that the morrow would be either wet or dry; upon\r\nwhich the lean young lady, having slapped him, asked admiringly of the\r\nfat young lady if he wasn't a “silly fool;” to which the fat young lady\r\nreplied, with somewhat unnecessary severity, I thought, that no one\r\ncould help being what they were born. To this the lean young lady\r\nretorted that it was with precisely similar reflection that she herself\r\ncontrolled her own feelings when tempted to resent the fat young lady's\r\n“nasty jealous temper.”\r\n\r\nThe threatened quarrel was nipped in the bud by the discretion of Miss\r\nSellars, who took the opportunity of the fat young lady's momentary\r\nspeechlessness to introduce me promptly to both of them. They also,\r\nI learned, were cousins. The lean girl said she had “erd on me,” and\r\nimmediately fell into an uncontrollable fit of giggles; of which the\r\nwatery-eyed Joseph requested me to take no notice, explaining that she\r\nalways went off like that at exactly three-quarters to the half-hour\r\nevery evening, Sundays and holidays excepted; that she had taken\r\neverything possible for it without effect, and that what he himself\r\nadvised was that she should have it off.\r\n\r\nThe fat girl, seizing the chance afforded her, remarked genteelly that\r\nshe too had “heard hof me,” with emphasis upon the “hof.” She also\r\nremarked it was a long walk from Blackfriars Bridge.\r\n\r\n“All depends upon the company, eh? Bet they didn't find it too long.”\r\n\r\nThis came from a loud-voiced, red-faced man sitting on the sofa beside a\r\nsomewhat melancholy-looking female dressed in bright green. These twain\r\nI discovered to be Uncle and Aunt Gutton. From an observation dropped\r\nlater in the evening concerning government restrictions on the sale of\r\nmethylated spirit, and hastily smothered, I gathered that their line was\r\noil and colour.\r\n\r\nMr. Gutton's forte appeared to be badinage. He it was who, on my\r\nexplaining my heightened colour as due to the closeness of the evening,\r\ncongratulated his niece on having secured so warm a partner.\r\n\r\n“Will be jolly handy,” shouted Uncle Gutton, “for Rosina, seeing she's\r\nalways complaining of her cold feet.”\r\n\r\nHere the lank young man attempted to squeeze himself into the room, but\r\nfound his entrance barred by the square, squat figure of the watery-eyed\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\n“Don't push,” advised the watery-eyed young man. “Walk over me quietly.”\r\n\r\n“Well, why don't yer get out of the way,” growled the lank young man,\r\nnow coated, but still aggressive.\r\n\r\n“Where am I to get to?” asked the watery-eyed young man, with some\r\nreason. “Say the word and I'll 'ang myself up to the gas bracket.”\r\n\r\n“In my courting days,” roared Uncle Gutton, “the girls used to be able\r\nto find seats, even if there wasn't enough chairs to go all round.”\r\n\r\nThe sentiment was received with varying degrees of approbation. The", " lank young man,\r\nnow coated, but still aggressive.\r\n\r\n“Where am I to get to?” asked the watery-eyed young man, with some\r\nreason. “Say the word and I'll 'ang myself up to the gas bracket.”\r\n\r\n“In my courting days,” roared Uncle Gutton, “the girls used to be able\r\nto find seats, even if there wasn't enough chairs to go all round.”\r\n\r\nThe sentiment was received with varying degrees of approbation. The\r\nwatery-eyed young man, sitting down, put the lean young lady on his\r\nknee, and in spite of her struggles and sounding slaps, heroically\r\nretained her there.\r\n\r\n“Now, then, Rosie,” shouted Uncle Gutton, who appeared to have\r\nconstituted himself master of the ceremonies, “don't stand about, my\r\ngirl; you'll get tired.”\r\n\r\nLeft to herself, I am inclined to think my _fiancee_ would have spared\r\nme; but Uncle Gutton, having been invited to a love comedy, was not\r\nto be cheated of any part of the performance, and the audience clearly\r\nbeing with him, there was nothing for it but compliance. I seated\r\nmyself, and amid plaudits accommodated the ample and heavy Rosina upon\r\nmy knee.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” called out to me the watery-eyed young man, as behind the\r\nfair Rosina I disappeared from his view. “See you again later on.”\r\n\r\n“I used to be a plump girl myself before I married,” observed Aunt\r\nGutton. “Plump as butter I was at one time.”\r\n\r\n“It isn't what one eats,” said the maternal Sellars. “I myself don't eat\r\nenough to keep a fly, and my legs--”\r\n\r\n“That'll do, Mar,” interrupted the filial Sellars, tartly.\r\n\r\n“I was only going to say, my dear--”\r\n\r\n“We all know what you was going to say, Mar,” retorted Miss Sellars.\r\n“We've heard it before, and it isn't interesting.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Sellars relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\n“'Ard work and plenty of it keeps you thin enough, I notice,” remarked\r\nthe lank young man, with bitterness. To him I was now introduced, he\r\nbeing Mr. George Sellars. “Seen 'im before,” was his curt greeting.\r\n\r\nAt supper--referred to by Mrs. Sellars again in the tone of one\r\nremembering a lesson, as a cold col-la-tion, with the accent on the\r\n“tion”--I sat between Miss Sellars and the lean young lady, with Aunt\r\nand Uncle Gutton opposite to us. It was remarked with approval that I\r\ndid not appear to be hungry.\r\n\r\n“Had too many kisses afore he started,” suggested Uncle Gutton, with\r\nhis mouth full of cold roast pork and pickles. “Wonderfully nourishing\r\nthing, kisses, eh? Look at mother and me. That's all we live on.”\r\n\r\nAunt Gutton sighed, and observed that she had always been a poor feeder.\r\n\r\nThe watery-eyed young man, observing he had never tasted them\r\nhimself--at which sally there was much laughter--said he would not mind\r\ntrying a sample if the lean young lady would kindly pass him one.\r\n\r\nThe lean young lady opined that, not being used to high living, it might\r\ndisagree with him.\r\n\r\n“Just one,” pleaded the watery-eyed young man, “to go with this bit of\r\ncracklin'.”\r\n\r\nThe lean young lady, amid renewed applause, first thoughtfully wiping\r\nher mouth, acceded to his request.\r\n\r\nThe watery-eyed young man turned it over with the air of a gourmet.\r\n\r\n“Not bad,” was his verdict. “Reminds me of onions.” At this there was\r\nanother burst of laughter.\r\n\r\n“Now then, ain't Paul goin' to have one?” shouted Uncle Gutton, when the\r\nlaughter had subsided.\r\n\r\nAmid silence, feeling as wretched as perhaps I have ever felt in my life\r\nbefore or since, I received one from the gracious Miss Sellars, wet and\r\nsounding.\r\n\r\n“Looks better for it already,” commented the delighted Uncle Gutton.\r\n“He'll soon get fat on 'em.”\r\n\r\n“Not too many at first,” advised the watery-eyed young man. “Looks to me\r\nas if he's got a weak stomach.”\r\n\r\nI think, had the meal lasted much longer, I should have made a dash for\r\nthe street; the contemplation of such step was forming in my mind. But\r\nMiss Sellars, looking at her watch, declared we must be getting home at\r\nonce, for the which I could have kissed her voluntarily; and, being a\r\nyoung lady of decision, at once rose and commenced leave-taking. Polite\r\nprotests were attempted, but these, with enthusiastic assistance from\r\nmyself, she swept aside.\r\n\r\n“Don't want any one to walk home with you?” suggested Uncle Gutton.\r\n“Sure you won't feel lonely by yourselves, eh?”\r\n\r\n“We shan't come to no harm,” assured him Miss Sellars.\r\n\r\n“P'raps you're right,” agreed Uncle Gutton. “There don't seem to be much\r\nof the fiery and untamed about him, so far as I can see.”\r\n\r\n“'Slow waters run deep,'” reminded us Aunt Gutton, with a waggish shake\r\nof her head.\r\n\r\n“No question about the slow,” assented Uncle Gutton. “If you don't like\r\nhim--” observed Miss Sellars, speaking with dignity.\r\n\r\n“To be quite candid with you, my girl, I don't,” answered Uncle Gutton,\r\nwhose temper, maybe as the result of too much cold pork and whiskey,\r\nseemed to have suddenly changed.\r\n\r\n“Well, he happens to be good enough for me,” recommenced Miss Sellars.\r\n\r\n“I'm sorry to hear a niece of mine say so,” interrupted Uncle Gutton.\r\n“If you want my opinion of him--”\r\n\r\n“If ever I do I'll call round some time when you're sober and ast you\r\nfor it,” returned Miss Sellars. “And as for being your niece, you was\r\nhere when I came, and I don't see very well as how I could have got out\r\nof it. You needn't throw that in my teeth.”\r\n\r\nThe gust was dispersed by the practical remark of brother George to the\r\neffect that the last tram for Walworth left the Oval at eleven-thirty;\r\nto which he further added the suggestion that the Clapham Road was wide\r\nand well adapted to a row.\r\n\r\n“There ain't going to be no rows,” replied Uncle Gutton, returning to\r\namiability as suddenly as he had departed from it. “We understand each\r\nother, don't we, my girl?”\r\n\r\n“That's all right, uncle. I know what you mean,” returned Miss Sellars,\r\nwith equal handsomeness.\r\n\r\n“Bring him round again when he's feeling better,” added Uncle Gutton,\r\n“and we'll have another look at him.”\r\n\r\n“What you want,” advised the watery-eyed young man on shaking hands with\r\nme, “is complete rest and a tombstone.”\r\n\r\nI wished at the time I could have followed his prescription.\r\n\r\nThe maternal Sellars waddled after us into the passage, which she\r\ncompletely blocked. She told me she was delight-ted to have met me, and\r\nthat she was always at home on Sundays.\r\n\r\nI said I would remember it, and thanked her warmly for a pleasant\r\nevening, at Miss Sellars' request calling her Ma.\r\n\r\nOutside, Miss Sellars agreed that my presentiment had proved\r\ncorrect--that I had not shone to advantage. Our journey home on a\r\ntramcar was a somewhat silent proceeding. At the door of her room she\r\nforgave me, and kissed me good night. Had I been frank with her, I\r\nshould have thanked her for that evening's experience. It had made my\r\ncourse plain to me.\r\n\r\nThe next day, which was Thursday, I wandered about the streets till two\r\no'clock in the morning, when I slipped in quietly, passing Miss Sellars'\r\ndoor with my boots in my hand.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Lott's departure on Friday, which, fortunately, was pay-day,\r\nI set my desk in order and confided to Minikin written instructions\r\nconcerning all matters unfinished.\r\n\r\n“I shall not be here to-morrow,” I told him. “Going to follow your\r\nadvice.”\r\n\r\n“Found anything to do?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Not yet,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Suppose you can't get anything?”\r\n\r\n“If the worst", " with my boots in my hand.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Lott's departure on Friday, which, fortunately, was pay-day,\r\nI set my desk in order and confided to Minikin written instructions\r\nconcerning all matters unfinished.\r\n\r\n“I shall not be here to-morrow,” I told him. “Going to follow your\r\nadvice.”\r\n\r\n“Found anything to do?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Not yet,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Suppose you can't get anything?”\r\n\r\n“If the worst comes to the worst,” I replied, “I can hang myself.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know the girl. Maybe you are right,” he agreed.\r\n\r\n“Hope it won't throw much extra work on you,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Well, I shan't be catching it if it does,” was his answer. “That's all\r\nright.”\r\n\r\nHe walked with me to the “Angel,” and there we parted.\r\n\r\n“If you do get on to the stage,” he said, “and it's anything worth\r\nseeing, and you send me an order, and I can find the time, maybe I'll\r\ncome and see you.”\r\n\r\nI thanked him for his promised support and jumped upon the tram.\r\n\r\nThe O'Kelly's address was in Belsize Square. I was about to ring and\r\nknock, as requested by a highly-polished brass plate, when I became\r\naware of pieces of small coal falling about me on the doorstep. Looking\r\nup, I perceived the O'Kelly leaning out of an attic window. From signs\r\nI gathered I was to retire from the doorstep and wait. In a few minutes\r\nthe door opened and his hand beckoned me to enter.\r\n\r\n“Walk quietly,” he whispered; and on tip-toe we climbed up to the attic\r\nfrom where had fallen the coal. “I've been waiting for ye,” explained\r\nthe O'Kelly, speaking low. “Me wife--a good woman, Paul; sure, a better\r\nwoman never lived; ye'll like her when ye know her, later on--she might\r\nnot care about ye're calling. She'd want to know where I met ye, and--ye\r\nunderstand? Besides,” added the O'Kelly, “we can smoke up here;” and\r\nseating himself where he could keep an eye upon the door, near to a\r\nsmall cupboard out of which he produced a pipe still alight, the O'Kelly\r\nprepared himself to listen.\r\n\r\nI told him briefly the reason of my visit.\r\n\r\n“It was my fault, Paul,” he was good enough to say; “my fault entirely.\r\nBetween ourselves, it was a damned silly idea, that party, the whole\r\nthing altogether. Don't ye think so?”\r\n\r\nI replied that I was naturally prejudiced against it myself.\r\n\r\n“Most unfortunate for me,” continued the O'Kelly; “I know that. Me\r\ncabman took me to Hammersmith instead of Hampstead; said I told him\r\nHammersmith. Didn't get home here till three o'clock in the morning.\r\nMost unfortunate--under the circumstances.”\r\n\r\nI could quite imagine it.\r\n\r\n“But I'm glad ye've come,” said the O'Kelly. “I had a notion ye did\r\nsomething foolish that evening, but I couldn't remember precisely what.\r\nIt's been worrying me.”\r\n\r\n“It's been worrying me also, I can assure you,” I told him; and I gave\r\nhim an account of my Wednesday evening's experience.\r\n\r\n“I'll go round to-morrow morning,” he said, “and see one or two people.\r\nIt's not a bad idea, that of Jarman's. I think I may be able to arrange\r\nsomething for ye.”\r\n\r\nHe fixed a time for me to call again upon him the next day, when Mrs.\r\nO'Kelly would be away from home. He instructed me to walk quietly up and\r\ndown on the opposite side of the road with my eye on the attic window,\r\nand not to come across unless he waved a handkerchief.\r\n\r\nRising to go, I thanked him for his kindness. “Don't put it that way, me\r\ndear Paul,” he answered. “If I don't get ye out of this scrape I shall\r\nnever forgive meself. If we damned silly fools don't help one another,”\r\n he added, with his pleasant laugh, “who is to help us?”\r\n\r\nWe crept downstairs as we had crept up. As we reached the first floor,\r\nthe drawing-room door suddenly opened.\r\n\r\n“William!” cried a sharp voice.\r\n\r\n“Me dear,” answered the O'Kelly, snatching his pipe from his mouth and\r\nthrusting it, still alight, into his trousers pocket. I made the rest\r\nof the descent by myself, and slipping out, closed the door behind me as\r\nnoiselessly as possible.\r\n\r\nAgain I did not return to Nelson Square until the early hours, and the\r\nnext morning did not venture out until I had heard Miss Sellars, who\r\nappeared to be in a bad temper, leave the house. Then running to the top\r\nof the kitchen stairs, I called for Mrs. Peedles. I told her I was going\r\nto leave her, and, judging the truth to be the simplest explanation, I\r\ntold her the reason why.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said Mrs. Peedles, “I am only too glad to hear it. It wasn't\r\nfor me to interfere, but I couldn't help seeing you were making a fool\r\nof yourself. I only hope you'll get clear off, and you may depend upon\r\nme to do all I can to help you.”\r\n\r\n“You don't think I'm acting dishonourably, do you, Mrs. Peedles?” I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” replied Mrs. Peedles, “it's a difficult world to live\r\nin--leastways, that's been my experience of it.”\r\n\r\nI had just completed my packing--it had not taken me long--when I\r\nheard upon the stairs the heavy panting that always announced to me the\r\nup-coming of Mrs. Peedles. She entered with a bundle of old manuscripts\r\nunder her arm, torn and tumbled booklets of various shapes and sizes.\r\nThese she plumped down upon the rickety table, and herself upon the\r\nnearest chair.\r\n\r\n“Put them in your box, my dear,” said Mrs. Peedles. “They'll come in\r\nuseful to you later on.”\r\n\r\nI glanced at the bundle. I saw it was a collection of old plays in\r\nmanuscript-prompt copies, scored, cut and interlined. The top one I\r\nnoticed was “The Bloodspot: Or the Maiden, the Miser and the Murderer;”\r\n the second, “The Female Highwayman.”\r\n\r\n“Everybody's forgotten 'em,” explained Mrs. Peedles, “but there's some\r\ngood stuff in all of them.”\r\n\r\n“But what am I to do with them?” I enquired.\r\n\r\n“Just whatever you like, my dear,” explained Mrs. Peedles. “It's quite\r\nsafe. They're all of 'em dead, the authors of 'em. I've picked 'em out\r\nmost carefully. You just take a scene from one and a scene from the\r\nother. With judgment and your talent you'll make a dozen good plays out\r\nof that little lot when your time comes.”\r\n\r\n“But they wouldn't be my plays, Mrs. Peedles,” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“They will if I give them to you,” answered Mrs. Peedles. “You put 'em\r\nin your box. And never mind the bit of rent,” added Mrs. Peedles; “you\r\ncan pay me that later on.”\r\n\r\nI kissed the kind old soul good-bye and took her gift with me to my new\r\nlodgings in Camden Town. Many a time have I been hard put to it for\r\nplot or scene, and more than once in weak mood have I turned with guilty\r\nintent the torn and crumpled pages of Mrs. Peedles's donation to my\r\nliterary equipment. It is pleasant to be able to put my hand upon my\r\nheart and reflect that never yet have I yielded to the temptation.\r\nAlways have I laid them back within their drawer, saying to myself, with\r\nstern reproof:\r\n\r\n“No, no, Paul. Stand or fall by your own merits. Never plagiarise--in\r\nany case, not from this 'little lot.'”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nLEADS TO A MEETING.\r\n\r\n“Don't be nervous,” said the O'Kelly, “and don't try to do too much.

You\r\nhave a very fair voice, but it's not powerful. Keep cool and open your\r\nmouth.”\r\n\r\nIt was eleven o'clock in the morning. We were standing at the entrance\r\nof the narrow court leading to the stage door. For a fortnight past the\r\nO'Kelly had been coaching me. It had been nervous work for both of us,\r\nbut especially for the O'Kelly. Mrs. O'Kelly, a thin, acid-looking lady,\r\nof whom I once or twice had caught a glimpse while promenading Belsize\r\nSquare awaiting the O'Kelly's signal, was a serious-minded lady, with a\r\nconscientious objection to all music not of a sacred character. With the\r\nhope of winning the O'Kelly from one at least of his sinful tendencies,\r\nthe piano had been got rid of, and its place in the drawing-room filled\r\nby an American organ of exceptionally lugubrious tone. With this we\r\nhad had to make shift, and though the O'Kelly--a veritable musical\r\ngenius--had succeeded in evolving from it an accompaniment to “Sally in\r\nOur Alley” less misleading and confusing than might otherwise have been\r\nthe case, the result had not been to lighten our labours. My rendering\r\nof the famous ballad had, in consequence, acquired a dolefulness not\r\nintended by the composer. Sung as I sang it, the theme became, to employ\r\na definition since grown hackneyed as applied to Art, a problem ballad.\r\nInvoluntarily one wondered whether the marriage would turn out as\r\nsatisfactorily as the young man appeared to anticipate. Was there not,\r\nwhen one came to think of it, a melancholy, a pessimism ingrained within\r\nthe temperament of the complainful hero that would ill assort with\r\nthose instincts toward frivolity the careful observer could not avoid\r\ndiscerning in the charming yet nevertheless somewhat shallow character\r\nof Sally.\r\n\r\n“Lighter, lighter. Not so soulful,” would demand the O'Kelly, as the\r\nsolemn notes rolled jerkily from the groaning instrument beneath his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nOnce we were nearly caught, Mrs. O'Kelly returning from a district\r\nvisitors' committee meeting earlier than was expected. Hastily I was\r\nhidden in a small conservatory adjutting from the first floor landing,\r\nwhere, crouching behind flower-pots, I listened in fear and trembling to\r\nthe severe cross-examination of the O'Kelly.\r\n\r\n“William, do not prevaricate. It was not a hymn.”\r\n\r\n“Me dear, so much depends upon the time. Let me give ye an example of\r\nwhat I mean.”\r\n\r\n“William, pray in my presence not to play tricks with sacred melodies.\r\nIf you have no respect for religion, please remember that I have.\r\nBesides, why should you be playing hymns in any time at ten o'clock\r\nin the morning? It is not like you, William, and I do not credit your\r\nexplanation. And you were singing. I distinctly heard the word 'Sally'\r\nas I opened the door.”\r\n\r\n“Salvation, me dear,” corrected the O'Kelly.\r\n\r\n“Your enunciation, William, is not usually so much at fault.”\r\n\r\n“A little hoarseness, me dear,” explained the O'Kelly.\r\n\r\n“Your voice did not sound hoarse. Perhaps it will be better if we do not\r\npursue the subject further.”\r\n\r\nWith this the O'Kelly appeared to agree.\r\n\r\n“A lady a little difficult to get on with when ye're feeling well and\r\nstrong,” so the O'Kelly would explain her; “but if ye happen to be ill,\r\none of the kindest, most devoted of women. When I was down with typhoid\r\nthree years ago, a tenderer nurse no man could have had. I shall never\r\nforget it. And so she would be again to-morrow, if there was anything\r\nserious the matter with me.”\r\n\r\nI murmured the well-known quotation.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. O'Kelly to a T,” concurred the O'Kelly. “I sometimes wonder if\r\nLady Scott may not have been the same sort of woman.”\r\n\r\n“The unfortunate part of it is,” continued the O'Kelly, “that I'm such\r\na healthy beggar; it don't give her a chance. If I were only a chronic\r\ninvalid, now, there's nothing that woman would not do to make me happy.\r\nAs it is--” The O'Kelly struck a chord. We resumed our studies.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our conversation at the stage door.\r\n\r\n“Meet me at the Cheshire Cheese at one o'clock,” said the O'Kelly,\r\nshaking hands. “If ye don't get on here, we'll try something else; but\r\nI've spoken to Hodgson, and I think ye will. Good luck to ye!”\r\n\r\nHe went his way and I mine. In a glass box just behind the door a\r\ncurved-nose, round-eyed little man, looking like an angry bird in a\r\ncage, demanded of me my business. I showed him my letter of appointment.\r\n\r\n“Up the passage, across the stage, along the corridor, first floor,\r\nsecond door on the right,” he instructed me in one breath, and shut the\r\nwindow with a snap.\r\n\r\nI proceeded up the passage. It somewhat surprised me to discover that\r\nI was not in the least excited at the thought of this, my first\r\nintroduction to “behind the scenes.”\r\n\r\nI recall my father's asking a young soldier on his return from the\r\nCrimea what had been his sensations at the commencement of his first\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied the young fellow, “I was worrying all the time,\r\nremembering I had rushed out leaving the beer tap running in the\r\ncanteen, and I could not forget it.”\r\n\r\nSo far as the stage I found my way in safety. Pausing for a moment and\r\nglancing round, my impression was not so much disillusionment concerning\r\nall things theatrical as realisation of my worst forebodings. In that\r\none moment all glamour connected with the stage fell from me, nor has it\r\nsince ever returned to me. From the tawdry decorations of the auditorium\r\nto the childish make-belief littered around on the stage, I saw the\r\nTheatre a painted thing of shreds and patches--the grown child's\r\ndoll's-house. The Drama may improve us, elevate us, interest and teach\r\nus. I am sure it does; long may it flourish! But so likewise does the\r\ndressing and undressing of dolls, the opening of the front of the house,\r\nand the tenderly putting of them away to bed in rooms they completely\r\nfill, train our little dears to the duties and the joys of motherhood.\r\nToys! what wise child despises them? Art, fiction, the musical glasses:\r\nare they not preparing us for the time, however distant, when we shall\r\nat last be grown up?\r\n\r\nIn a maze of ways beyond the stage I lost myself, but eventually, guided\r\nby voices, came to a large room furnished barely with many chairs\r\nand worn settees, and here I found some twenty to thirty ladies\r\nand gentlemen already seated. They were of varying ages, sizes\r\nand appearance, but all of them alike in having about them that\r\nimpossible-to-define but impossible-to-mistake suggestion of\r\ntheatricality. The men were chiefly remarkable for having no hair on\r\ntheir faces, but a good deal upon their heads; the ladies, one and\r\nall, were blessed with remarkably pink and white complexions and\r\nexceptionally bright eyes. The conversation, carried on in subdued but\r\npenetrating voices, was chiefly of “him” and “her.” Everybody appeared\r\nto be on an affectionate footing with everybody else, the terms of\r\naddress being “My dear,” “My love,” “Old girl,” “Old chappie,” Christian\r\nnames--when name of any sort was needful--alone being employed. I\r\nhesitated for a minute with the door in my hand, fearing I had stumbled\r\nupon a family gathering. As, however, nobody seemed disconcerted at my\r\nentry, I ventured to take a", "her.” Everybody appeared\r\nto be on an affectionate footing with everybody else, the terms of\r\naddress being “My dear,” “My love,” “Old girl,” “Old chappie,” Christian\r\nnames--when name of any sort was needful--alone being employed. I\r\nhesitated for a minute with the door in my hand, fearing I had stumbled\r\nupon a family gathering. As, however, nobody seemed disconcerted at my\r\nentry, I ventured to take a vacant seat next to an extremely small and\r\nboyish-looking gentleman and to ask him if this was the room in which I,\r\nan applicant for a place in the chorus of the forthcoming comic opera,\r\nought to be waiting.\r\n\r\nHe had large, fishy eyes, with which he looked me up and down. For such\r\na length of time he remained thus regarding me in silence that a massive\r\ngentleman sitting near, who had overheard, took it upon himself to reply\r\nin the affirmative, adding that from what he knew of Butterworth we\r\nwould all of us be waiting here a damned sight longer than any gentleman\r\nshould keep other ladies and gentlemen waiting for no reason at all.\r\n\r\n“I think it exceedingly bad form,” observed the fishy-eyed gentleman,\r\nin deep contralto tones, “for any gentleman to take it upon himself to\r\nreply to a remark addressed to quite another gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” retorted the large gentleman. “I thought you were\r\nasleep.”\r\n\r\n“I think it very ill manners,” remarked the small gentlemen in the same\r\nslow and impressive tones, “for any gentleman to tell another gentleman,\r\nwho happens to be wide awake, that he thought he was asleep.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” returned the massive gentleman, assuming with the help of a large\r\numbrella a quite Johnsonian attitude, “I decline to alter my manners to\r\nsuit your taste.”\r\n\r\n“If you are satisfied with them,” replied the small gentleman, “I cannot\r\nhelp it. But I think you are making a mistake.”\r\n\r\n“Does anybody know what the opera is about?” asked a bright little woman\r\nat the other end of the room.\r\n\r\n“Does anybody ever know what a comic opera is about?” asked another\r\nlady, whose appearance suggested experience.\r\n\r\n“I once asked the author,” observed a weary-looking gentleman, speaking\r\nfrom a corner. “His reply was: 'Well, if you had asked me at the\r\nbeginning of the rehearsals I might have been able to tell you, but\r\ndamned if I could now!'”\r\n\r\n“It wouldn't surprise me,” observed a good-looking gentleman in a velvet\r\ncoat, “if there occurred somewhere in the proceedings a drinking chorus\r\nfor male voices.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly, if we are good,” added a thin lady with golden hair, “the\r\nheroine will confide to us her love troubles, which will interest us and\r\nexcite us.”\r\n\r\nThe door at the further end of the room opened and a name was called.\r\nAn elderly lady rose and went out.\r\n\r\n“Poor old Gertie!” remarked sympathetically the thin lady with the\r\ngolden hair. “I'm told that she really had a voice once.”\r\n\r\n“When poor young Bond first came to London,” said the massive gentleman\r\nwho was sitting on my left, “I remember his telling me he applied to\r\nLord Barrymore's 'tiger,' Alexander Lee, I mean, of course, who was then\r\nrunning the Strand Theatre, for a place in the chorus. Lee heard him\r\nsing two lines, and then jumped up. 'Thanks, that'll do; good morning,'\r\nsays Lee. Bond knew he had got a good voice, so he asked Lee what was\r\nwrong. 'What's wrong?' shouts Lee. 'Do you think I hire a chorus to show\r\nup my principals?'”\r\n\r\n“Having regard to the company present,” commented the fishy-eyed\r\ngentleman, “I consider that anecdote as distinctly lacking in tact.”\r\n\r\nThe feeling of the company appeared to be with the fish-eyed young man.\r\n\r\nFor the next half hour the door at the further end of the room continued\r\nto open and close, devouring, ogre-fashion, each time some dainty human\r\nmorsel, now chorus gentleman, now chorus lady. Conversation among our\r\nthinning ranks became more fitful, a growing anxiety making for silence.\r\n\r\nAt length, “Mr. Horace Moncrieff” called the voice of the unseen Charon.\r\nIn common with the rest, I glanced round languidly to see what sort of\r\nman “Mr. Horace Moncrieff” might be. The door was pushed open further.\r\nCharon, now revealed as a pale-faced young man with a drooping\r\nmoustache, put his head into the room and repeated impatiently his\r\ninvitation to the apparently coy Moncrieff. It suddenly occurred to me\r\nthat I was Mr. Horace Moncrieff.\r\n\r\n“So glad you've found yourself,” said the pale-faced young man, as I\r\njoined him at the door. “Please don't lose yourself again; we're rather\r\npressed for time.”\r\n\r\nI crossed with him through a deserted refreshment bar--one of the\r\nsaddest of sights--into a room beyond. A melancholy-looking gentleman\r\nwas seated at the piano. Beside him stood a tall, handsome man, who\r\nwas opening and reading rapidly from a bundle of letters he held in his\r\nhand. A big, burly, bored-looking gentleman was making desperate\r\nefforts to be amused at the staccato conversation of a sharp-faced,\r\nrestless-eyed gentleman, whose peculiarity was that he never by any\r\nchance looked at the person to whom he was talking, but always at\r\nsomething or somebody else.\r\n\r\n“Moncrieff?” enquired the tall, handsome man--whom I later discovered to\r\nbe Mr. Hodgson, the manager--without raising his eyes from his letters.\r\n\r\nThe pale-faced gentleman responded for me.\r\n\r\n“Fire away,” said Mr. Hodgson.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked of me wearily the melancholy gentleman at the piano.\r\n\r\n“'Sally in Our Alley,'” I replied.\r\n\r\n“What are you?” interrupted Mr. Hodgson. He had never once looked at me,\r\nand did not now.\r\n\r\n“A tenor,” I replied. “Not a full tenor,” I added, remembering the\r\nO'Kelly's instructions.\r\n\r\n“Utterly impossible to fill a tenor,” remarked the restless-eyed\r\ngentleman, looking at me and speaking to the worried-looking gentleman.\r\n“Ever tried?”\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed, with the exception of the melancholy gentleman at the\r\npiano, Mr. Hodgson throwing in his contribution without raising his eyes\r\nfrom his letters. Throughout the proceedings the restless-eyed gentleman\r\ncontinued to make humorous observations of this nature, at which\r\neverybody laughed, excepting always the melancholy pianist--a short,\r\nsharp, mechanical laugh, devoid of the least suggestion of amusement.\r\nThe restless-eyed gentleman, it appeared, was the leading low comedian\r\nof the theatre.\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said the melancholy gentleman, and commenced the accompaniment.\r\n\r\n“Tell me when he's going to begin,” remarked Mr. Hodgson at the\r\nconclusion of the first verse.\r\n\r\n“He has a fair voice,” said my accompanist. “He's evidently nervous.”\r\n\r\n“There is a prejudice throughout theatrical audiences,” observed Mr.\r\nHodgson, “in favour of a voice they can hear. That is all I am trying to\r\nimpress upon him.”\r\n\r\nThe second verse, so I imagined, I sang in the voice of a trumpet. The\r\nburly gentleman--the translator of the French libretto, as he turned\r\nout to be; the author of the English version, as he preferred to\r\nbe called--acknowledged to having distinctly detected a sound. The\r\nrestless-eyed comedian suggested an announcement from the stage\r\nrequesting strict silence during my part of the performance.\r\n\r\nThe sickness of fear was stealing over me. My voice, so it seemed to me,\r\ndisappointed at the effect it had produced, had retired, sulky, into my\r\nboots, whence it refused to emerge.\r\n\r\n“Your voice is all right--very good,” whispered the musical conductor.\r\n“They want to hear the best you can do, that's all.”\r\n\r\nAt this my voice ran up my legs and out of my mouth. “Thirty shillings\r\na week, half salary for rehearsals. If that's all right, Mr. Catchpole\r\nwill give you your agreement. If not, very much obliged. Good morning,”\r\n said Mr. Hodgson, still absorbed in his correspondence.\r\n\r\nWith the pale-faced young man I", "--very good,” whispered the musical conductor.\r\n“They want to hear the best you can do, that's all.”\r\n\r\nAt this my voice ran up my legs and out of my mouth. “Thirty shillings\r\na week, half salary for rehearsals. If that's all right, Mr. Catchpole\r\nwill give you your agreement. If not, very much obliged. Good morning,”\r\n said Mr. Hodgson, still absorbed in his correspondence.\r\n\r\nWith the pale-faced young man I retired to a desk in the corner, where\r\na few seconds sufficed for the completion of the business. Leaving, I\r\nsought to catch the eye of my melancholy friend, but he appeared too\r\nsunk in dejection to notice anything. The restless-eyed comedian,\r\nlooking at the author of the English version and addressing me as\r\nBoanerges, wished me good morning, at which the everybody laughed; and,\r\ninformed as to the way out by the pale-faced Mr. Catchpole, I left.\r\n\r\nThe first “call” was for the following Monday at two o'clock. I found\r\nthe theatre full of life and bustle. The principals, who had just\r\nfinished their own rehearsal, were talking together in a group. We\r\nladies and gentlemen of the chorus filled the centre of the stage. I\r\nnoticed the lady I had heard referred to as Gertie; as also the thin\r\nlady with the golden hair. The massive gentleman and the fishy-eyed\r\nyoung man were again in close proximity; so long as I knew them they\r\nalways were together, possessed, apparently, of a sympathetic antipathy\r\nfor each other. The fishy-eyed young gentleman was explaining the age at\r\nwhich he thought decayed chorus singers ought, in justice to themselves\r\nand the public, to retire from the profession; the massive gentleman,\r\nthe age and size at which he thought parcels of boys ought to be\r\nlearning manners across their mother's knee.\r\n\r\nMr. Hodgson, still reading letters exactly as I had left him four days\r\nago, stood close to the footlights. My friend, the musical director,\r\narmed with a violin and supported by about a dozen other musicians,\r\noccupied the orchestra. The adapter and the stage manager--a Frenchman\r\nwhom I found it good policy to mistake for a born Englishman--sat\r\ndeep in confabulation at a small table underneath a temporary gas jet.\r\nQuarter of an hour or so passed by, and then the stage manager, becoming\r\nsuddenly in a hurry, rang a small bell furiously.\r\n\r\n“Clear, please; all clear,” shouted a small boy, with important air\r\nsuggestive of a fox terrier; and, following the others, I retreated to\r\nthe wings.\r\n\r\nThe comedian and the leading lady--whom I knew well from the front,\r\nbut whom I should never have recognised--severed themselves from their\r\ncompanions and joined Mr. Hodgson by the footlights. As a preliminary we\r\nwere sorted out, according to our sizes, into loving couples.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the stage manager, casting an admiring gaze upon the\r\nfishy-eyed young man, whose height might have been a little over five\r\nfeet two, “I have the very girl for you--a beauty!” Darting into the\r\ngroup of ladies, he returned with quite the biggest specimen, a lady\r\nof magnificent proportions, whom, with the air of the virtuous uncle\r\nof melodrama, he bestowed upon the fishy-eyed young man. To the massive\r\ngentleman was given a sharp-faced little lady, who at a distance\r\nappeared quite girlish. Myself I found mated to the thin lady with the\r\ngolden hair.\r\n\r\nAt last complete, we took our places in the then approved semi-circle,\r\nand the attenuated orchestra struck up the opening chorus. My music,\r\nwhich had been sent me by post, I had gone over with the O'Kelly, and\r\nabout that I felt confident; but for the rest, ill at ease.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid,” said the thin lady, “I must ask you to put your arm round\r\nmy waist. It's very shocking, I know, but, you see, our salary depends\r\nupon it. Do you think you could manage it?”\r\n\r\nI glanced into her face. A whimsical expression of fun replied to me and\r\ndrove away my shyness. I carried out her instructions to the best of my\r\nability.\r\n\r\nThe indefatigable stage manager ran in and out among us while we sang,\r\ndriving this couple back a foot or so, this other forward, herding this\r\ngroup closer together, throughout another making space, suggesting the\r\nidea of a sheep-dog at work.\r\n\r\n“Very good, very good indeed,” commented Mr. Hodgson at the conclusion.\r\n“We will go over it once more, and this time in tune.”\r\n\r\n“And we will make love,” added the stage manager; “not like marionettes,\r\nbut like ladies and gentlemen all alive.” Seizing the lady nearest to\r\nhim, he explained to us by object lesson how the real peasant invariably\r\nbehaves when under influence of the grand passion, standing gracefully\r\nwith hands clasped upon heart, head inclined at an angle of forty-five,\r\nhis whole countenance eloquent with tender adoration.\r\n\r\n“If he expects” remarked the massive gentleman _sotto voce_ to an\r\nexperienced-looking young lady, “a performance of Romeo thrown in, I,\r\nfor one, shall want an extra ten shillings a week.”\r\n\r\nCasting the lady aside and seizing upon a gentleman, our stage manager\r\nthen proceeded to show the ladies how a village maiden should receive\r\naffectionate advances: one shoulder a trifle higher than the other, body\r\nfrom the waist upward gently waggling, roguish expression in left eye.\r\n\r\n“Ah, he's a bit new to it,” replied the experienced young lady. “He'll\r\nget over all that.”\r\n\r\nAgain we started. Whether others attempted to follow the stage manager's\r\ndirections I cannot say, my whole attention being centred upon the\r\nfishy-eyed young man, who did, implicitly. Soon it became apparent that\r\nthe whole of us were watching the fishy-eyed young man to the utter\r\nneglect of our own business. Mr. Hodgson even looked up from his\r\nletters; the orchestra was playing out of time; the author of the\r\nEnglish version and the leading lady exchanged glances. Three people\r\nonly appeared not to be enjoying themselves: the chief comedian, the\r\nstage manager and the fishy-eyed young gentleman himself, who pursued\r\nhis labours methodically and conscientiously. There was a whispered\r\nconfabulation between the leading low comedian, Mr. Hodgson and the\r\nstage manager. As a result, the music ceased and the fishy-eyed young\r\ngentleman was requested to explain what he was doing.\r\n\r\n“Only making love,” replied the fishy-eyed young gentleman.\r\n\r\n“You were playing the fool, sir,” retorted the leading low comedian,\r\nseverely.\r\n\r\n“That is a very unkind remark,” replied the fishy-eyed young gentleman,\r\nevidently hurt, “to make to a gentleman who is doing his best.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hodgson behind his letters was laughing. “Poor fellow,” he murmured;\r\n“I suppose he can't help it. Go on.”\r\n\r\n“We are not producing a pantomime, you know,” urged our comedian.\r\n\r\n“I want to give him a chance, poor devil,” explained Mr. Hodgson in a\r\nlower voice. “Only support of a widowed mother.”\r\n\r\nOur comedian appeared inclined to argue; but at this point Mr. Hodgson's\r\ncorrespondence became absorbing.\r\n\r\nFor the chorus the second act was a busy one. We opened as soldiers\r\nand vivandieres, every warrior in this way possessing his own private\r\ntravelling bar. Our stage manager again explained to us by example how\r\na soldier behaves, first under stress of patriotic emotion, and secondly\r\nunder stress of cheap cognac, the difference being somewhat subtle:\r\npatriotism displaying itself by slaps upon the chest, and cheap cognac\r\nby slaps upon the forehead. A little later we were conspirators; our\r\nstage manager, with the help of a tablecloth, showed us how to conspire.\r\nNext we were a mob, led by the sentimental baritone; our stage manager,\r\nruffling his hair, expounded to us how a mob led by a sentimental\r\nbaritone would naturally behave itself. The act wound up with a fight.\r\nOur stage manager, minus his coat, demonstrated to us how to fight and\r\ndie, the dying being a painful and dusty performance, necessitating, as", " our\r\nstage manager, with the help of a tablecloth, showed us how to conspire.\r\nNext we were a mob, led by the sentimental baritone; our stage manager,\r\nruffling his hair, expounded to us how a mob led by a sentimental\r\nbaritone would naturally behave itself. The act wound up with a fight.\r\nOur stage manager, minus his coat, demonstrated to us how to fight and\r\ndie, the dying being a painful and dusty performance, necessitating, as\r\nit did, much rolling about on the stage. The fishy-eyed young gentleman\r\nthroughout the whole of it was again the centre of attraction. Whether\r\nhe were solemnly slapping his chest and singing about glory, or solemnly\r\npatting his head and singing about grapes, was immaterial: he was the\r\nsoldier for us. What the plot was about did not matter, so long as he\r\nwas in it. Who led the mob one did not care; one's desire was to see\r\nhim lead. How others fought and died was matter of no moment; to see him\r\nslaughtered was sufficient. Whether his unconsciousness was assumed or\r\nnatural I cannot say; in either case it was admirable. An earnest young\r\nman, over-anxious, if anything, to do his duty by his employers, was\r\nthe extent of the charge that could be brought against him. Our chief\r\ncomedian frowned and fumed; our stage manager was in despair. Mr.\r\nHodgson and the author of the English version, on the contrary, appeared\r\nkindly disposed towards the gentleman. In addition to the widowed\r\nmother, Mr. Hodgson had invented for him five younger brothers and\r\nsisters utterly destitute but for his earnings. To deprive so exemplary\r\na son and brother of the means of earning a livelihood for dear ones\r\ndependent upon him was not in Mr. Hodgson's heart. Our chief comedian\r\ndissociated himself from all uncharitable feelings--would subscribe\r\ntowards the subsistence of the young man out of his own pocket, his\r\nonly concern being the success of the opera. The author of the English\r\nversion was convinced the young man would not accept a charity; had\r\nknown him for years--was a most sensitive creature.\r\n\r\nThe rehearsal proceeded. In the last act it became necessary for me to\r\nkiss the thin lady.\r\n\r\n“I am very sorry,” said the thin lady, “but duty is duty. It has to be\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\nAgain I followed directions. The thin lady was good enough to\r\ncongratulate me on my performance.\r\n\r\nThe last three or four rehearsals we performed in company with the\r\nprincipals. Divided counsels rendered them decidedly harassing. Our\r\nchief comedian had his views, and they were decided; the leading lady\r\nhad hers, and was generous with them. The author of the English version\r\npossessed his also, but of these nobody took much notice. Once every\r\ntwenty minutes the stage manager washed his hands of the whole affair\r\nand left the theatre in despair, and anybody's hat that happened to\r\nbe handy, to return a few minutes later full of renewed hope. The\r\nsentimental baritone was sarcastic, the tenor distinctly rude to\r\neverybody. Mr. Hodgson's method was to agree with all and listen to\r\nnone. The smaller fry of the company, together with the more pushing of\r\nthe chorus, supported each in turn, when the others were not looking. Up\r\nto the dress rehearsal it was anybody's opera.\r\n\r\nAbout one thing, and about one thing, only, had the principals fallen\r\ninto perfect agreement, and that was that the fishy-eyed young gentleman\r\nwas out of place in a romantic opera. The tenor would be making\r\nimpassioned love to the leading lady. Perception would come to both of\r\nthem that, though they might be occupying geographically the centre of\r\nthe stage, dramatically they were not. Without a shred of evidence,\r\nyet with perfect justice, they would unhesitatingly blame for this the\r\nfishy-eyed young man.\r\n\r\n“I wasn't doing anything,” he would explain meekly. “I was only\r\nlooking.” It was perfectly true; that was all he was doing.\r\n\r\n“Then don't look,” would comment the tenor.\r\n\r\nThe fishy-eyed young gentleman obediently would turn his face away from\r\nthem; and in some mysterious manner the situation would thereupon become\r\neven yet more hopelessly ridiculous.\r\n\r\n“My scene, I think, sir!” would thunder our chief comedian, a little\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\n“I am only doing what I was told to do,” answered the fishy-eyed young\r\ngentleman; and nobody could say that he was not.\r\n\r\n“Take a circus, and run him as a side-show,” counselled our comedian.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid he would never be any good as a side-show,” replied Mr.\r\nHodgson, who was reading letters.\r\n\r\nOn the first night, passing the gallery entrance on my way to the stage\r\ndoor, the sight of the huge crowd assembled there waiting gave me my\r\nfirst taste of artistic joy. I was a part of what they had come to see,\r\nto praise or to condemn, to listen to, to watch. Within the theatre\r\nthere was an atmosphere of suppressed excitement, amounting almost to\r\nhysteria. The bird-like gentleman in his glass cage was fluttering,\r\nagitated. The hands of the stage carpenters putting the finishing\r\ntouches to the scenery were trembling, their voices passionate\r\nwith anxiety; the fox-terrier-like call-boy was pale with sense of\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nI made my way to the dressing-room--a long, low, wooden corridor,\r\nfurnished from end to end with a wide shelf that served as common\r\ndressing-table, lighted by a dozen flaring gas-jets, wire-shielded. Here\r\nawaited us gentlemen of the chorus the wigmaker's assistant, whose duty\r\nit was to make us up. From one to another he ran, armed with his hare's\r\nfoot, his box of paints and his bundle of crepe hair. My turn arriving,\r\nhe seized me by the head, jabbed a wig upon me, and in less than a\r\ncouple of minutes I left his hands the orthodox peasant of the stage,\r\nwhite of forehead and pink of cheek, with curly moustache and lips of\r\ncoral. Glancing into the glass, I could not help feeling pleased with\r\nmyself; a moustache, without doubt, suited me.\r\n\r\nThe chorus ladies, when I met them on the stage, were a revelation\r\nto me. Paint and powder though I knew their appearance to consist\r\nof chiefly, yet in that hot atmosphere of the theatre, under that\r\nartificial glare, it seemed fit and fascinating. The close approximation\r\nto so much bare flesh, its curious, subtle odour was almost\r\nintoxicating. Dr. Johnson's excuse to Garrick for the rarity of his\r\nvisits to the theatre recurred to me with understanding.\r\n\r\n“How do you like my costume?” asked the thin lady with the golden hair.\r\n\r\n“I think you--” We were standing apart behind a piece of projecting\r\nscenery. She laid her hand upon my mouth, laughing.\r\n\r\n“How old are you?” she asked me.\r\n\r\n“Isn't that a rude question?” I answered. “I don't ask your age.\r\n\r\n“Mine,” she replied, “entitles me to talk to you as I should to a boy of\r\nmy own--I had one once. Get out of this life if you can. It's bad for\r\na woman; it's worse still for a man. To you especially it will be\r\nharmful.”\r\n\r\n“Why to me in particular?”\r\n\r\n“Because you are an exceedingly foolish little boy,” she answered, with\r\nanother laugh, “and are rather nice.”\r\n\r\nShe slipped away and joined the others. The chorus was now entirely\r\nassembled on the stage. The sound of the rapidly-filling house reached\r\nus, softened through the thick baize curtain, a dull, continuous\r\ndroning, as of water pouring into some huge cistern. Suddenly there fell\r\nupon our ears a startling crash; the overture had commenced.

The stage\r\nmanager--more suggestive of a sheep-dog than ever, but lacking the calm\r\ndignity, the self-possession born of conscious capability distinctive of\r\nhis prototype; a fussy, argumentative sheep-dog--rushed into the midst\r\nof us and worried us into our positions, where the more experienced\r\ncontinued to converse in whispers, the rest of us waiting nervously,\r\ntrying to remember our words. The chorus master, taking his stand with\r\nhis back to the proscenium, held his white-gloved hand in readiness. The\r\ncurtain rushed up, the house, a nightmare of white faces, appearing to\r\nrun towards us. The chorus-master's white-gloved hand flung upward. A\r\nroar of voices struck upon my ear, but whether my own were of them\r\nI could not say; if I were singing at all it was unconsciously,\r\nmechanically. Later, I found myself standing in the wings beside the\r\nthin lady; the stage was in the occupation of the principals. On my next\r\nentrance my senses were more with me; I was able to look about me. Here\r\nand there a strongly-marked face among the audience stood out, but the\r\nmajority were as indistinguishable as so many blades of grass. Looked at\r\nfrom the stage, the house seemed no more real than from the front do the\r\npainted faces upon a black cloth.\r\n\r\nThe curtain fell amid the usual applause, sounding to us behind it like\r\nthe rattle of tiny stones against a window-pane. Three times it rose\r\nand fell, like the opening and shutting of a door; and then followed a\r\nscamper for the dressing-rooms, the long corridors being filled with the\r\nrustling of skirts and the scurrying of feet.\r\n\r\nIt was in the second act that the fishy-eyed young gentleman came into\r\nhis own. The chorus had lingered till it was quite apparent that the\r\ntenor and the leading lady were in love with each other; then, with the\r\nexquisite delicacy so characteristic of a chorus, foreseeing that its\r\nfurther presence might be embarrassing, it turned to go, half to the\r\neast, the other half to the west. The fishy-eyed young man, starting\r\nfrom the centre, was the last to leave the stage. In another moment he\r\nwould have disappeared from view. There came a voice from the gallery,\r\nclear, distinct, pathetic with entreaty:\r\n\r\n“Don't go. Get behind a tree.”\r\n\r\nThe request was instantly seconded by a roar of applause from every part\r\nof the house, followed by laughter. From that point onward the house was\r\nchiefly concerned with the fortunes of the fishy-eyed young gentleman.\r\nAt his next entrance, disguised as a conspirator, he was welcomed\r\nwith enthusiasm, his passing away regretted loudly. At the fall of the\r\ncurtain, the tenor, furious, rushed up to him, and, shaking a fist in\r\nhis face, demanded what he meant by it.\r\n\r\n“I wasn't doing anything,” explained the fishy-eyed young man.\r\n\r\n“You went off sideways!” roared the tenor.\r\n\r\n“Well, you told me not to look at you,” explained meekly the fishy-eyed\r\nyoung gentleman. “I must go off somehow. I regard you as a very\r\ndifficult man to please.”\r\n\r\nAt the final fall of the curtain the house appeared divided as regarded\r\nthe merits of the opera; but for “Goggles” there was a unanimous and\r\nenthusiastic call, and the while we were dressing a message came for\r\n“Goggles” that Mr. Hodgson wished to see him in his private room.\r\n\r\n“He can make a funny face, no doubt about it,” commented one gentleman,\r\nas “Goggles” left the room.\r\n\r\n“I defy him to make a funnier one than God Almighty's made for him,”\r\n responded the massive gentleman.\r\n\r\n“There's a deal in luck,” observed, with a sigh, another, a tall,\r\nhandsome young gentleman possessed of a rich bass voice.\r\n\r\nLeaving the stage door, I encountered a group of gentlemen waiting upon\r\nthe pavement outside. Not interested in them myself, I was hurrying\r\npast, when one laid a hand upon my shoulder. I turned. He was a big,\r\nbroad-shouldered fellow, with a dark Vandyke beard and soft, dreamy\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“Dan!” I cried.\r\n\r\n“I thought it was you, young 'un, in the first act,” he answered. “In\r\nthe second, when you came on without a moustache, I knew it. Are you in\r\na hurry?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” I answered. “Are you?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he replied; “we don't go to press till Thursday, so I can write my\r\nnotice to-morrow. Come and have supper with me at the Albion and we will\r\ntalk. You look tired, young 'un.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I assured him, “only excited--partly at meeting you.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed, and drew my arm through his.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nHOW ON A SWEET GREY MORNING THE FUTURE CAME TO PAUL.\r\n\r\nOver our supper Dan and I exchanged histories. They revealed points of\r\nsimilarity. Leaving school some considerable time earlier than myself,\r\nDan had gone to Cambridge; but two years later, in consequence of the\r\ndeath of his father, of a wound contracted in the Indian Mutiny and\r\nnever cured, had been compelled to bring his college career to an\r\nuntimely termination.\r\n\r\n“You might not have expected that to grieve me,” said Dan, with a smile,\r\n“but, as a matter of fact, it was a severe blow to me. At Cambridge I\r\ndiscovered that I was by temperament a scholar. The reason why at school\r\nI took no interest in learning was because learning was, of set purpose,\r\nmade as uninteresting as possible. Like a Cook's tourist party through a\r\npicture gallery, we were rushed through education; the object being not\r\nthat we should see and understand, but that we should be able to say\r\nthat we had done it. At college I chose my own subjects, studied them\r\nin my own way. I fed on knowledge, was not stuffed with it like a\r\nStrassburg goose.”\r\n\r\nReturning to London, he had taken a situation in a bank, the chairman of\r\nwhich had been an old friend of his father. The advantage was that while\r\nearning a small income he had time to continue his studies; but the\r\ndeadly monotony of the work had appalled him, and upon the death of his\r\nmother he had shaken the cloying dust of the City from his brain and\r\njoined a small “fit-up” theatrical company. On the stage he had remained\r\nfor another eighteen months; had played all roles, from “Romeo” to “Paul\r\nPry,” had helped to paint the scenery, had assisted in the bill-posting.\r\nThe latter, so he told me, he had found one of the most difficult of\r\naccomplishments, the paste-laden poster having an innate tendency to\r\nrecoil upon the amateur's own head, and to stick there. Wearying of the\r\nstage proper, he had joined a circus company, had been “Signor Ricardo,\r\nthe daring bare-back rider,” also one of the “Brothers Roscius in their\r\nmarvellous trapeze act;” inclining again towards respectability, had\r\nbeen a waiter for three months at Ostend; from that, a footman.\r\n\r\n“One never knows,” remarked Dan. “I may come to be a society novelist;\r\nif so, inside knowledge of the aristocracy will give me decided\r\nadvantage over the majority of my competitors.”\r\n\r\nOther callings he had sampled: had tramped through Ireland with a\r\nfiddle; through Scotland with a lecture on Palestine, assisted by\r\ndissolving views; had been a billiard-marker; next a schoolmaster. For\r\nthe last three months he had been a journalist, dramatic and musical\r\ncritic to a Sunday newspaper. Often had I dreamt of such a position for\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n“How did you obtain it?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“The idea occurred to me,” replied Dan, “late one afternoon, sauntering\r\ndown the Strand, wondering what I should do next. I was on my beam ends,\r\nwith only a few shillings in my pocket; but luck has always been with\r\nme. I entered the first newspaper office I came to, walked upstairs to\r\nthe first floor, and", " newspaper. Often had I dreamt of such a position for\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n“How did you obtain it?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“The idea occurred to me,” replied Dan, “late one afternoon, sauntering\r\ndown the Strand, wondering what I should do next. I was on my beam ends,\r\nwith only a few shillings in my pocket; but luck has always been with\r\nme. I entered the first newspaper office I came to, walked upstairs to\r\nthe first floor, and opening the first door without knocking, passed\r\nthrough a small, empty room into a larger one, littered with books and\r\npapers. It was growing dark. A gentleman of extremely youthful figure\r\nwas running round and round, cursing to himself because of three things:\r\nhe had upset the ink, could not find the matches, and had broken the\r\nbell-pull. In the gloom, assuming him to be the office boy, I thought\r\nit would be fun to mistake him for the editor. As a matter of fact,\r\nhe turned out to be the editor. I lit the gas for him, and found him\r\nanother ink-pot. He was a slim young man with the voice and manner of a\r\nschoolboy. I don't suppose he is any more than five or six-and-twenty.\r\nHe owes his position to the fact of his aunt's being the proprietress.\r\nHe asked me if he knew me. Before I could tell him that he didn't, he\r\nwent on talking. He appeared to be labouring under a general sense of\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\n“'People come into this office,' he said; 'they seem to look upon it as\r\na shelter from the rain--people I don't know from Adam. And that damned\r\nfool downstairs lets them march straight up--anybody, men with articles\r\non safety valves, people who have merely come to kick up a row about\r\nsomething or another. Half my work I have to do on the stairs.\r\n\r\n“I recommended to him that he should insist upon strangers writing their\r\nbusiness upon a slip of paper. He thought it a good idea.\r\n\r\n“'For the last three-quarters of an hour,' he said, 'have I been trying\r\nto finish this one column, and four times have I been interrupted.'\r\n\r\n“At that precise moment there came another knock at the door.\r\n\r\n“'I won't see him!' he cried. 'I don't care who he is; I won't see him.\r\nSend him away! Send everybody away!'\r\n\r\n“I went to the door. He was an elderly gentleman. He made to sweep by\r\nme; but I barred his way, and closed the editorial door behind me. He\r\nseemed surprised; but I told him it was impossible for him to see the\r\neditor that afternoon, and suggested his writing his business on a sheet\r\nof paper, which I handed to him for the purpose. I remained in that\r\nante-room for half an hour, and during that time I suppose I must have\r\nsent away about ten or a dozen people. I don't think their business\r\ncould have been important, or I should have heard about it afterwards.\r\nThe last to come was a tired-looking gentleman, smoking a cigarette. I\r\nasked him his name.\r\n\r\n“He looked at me in surprise, and then answered, 'Idiot!'\r\n\r\n“I remained firm, however, and refused to let him pass.\r\n\r\n“'It's a bit awkward,' he retorted. 'Don't you think you could make an\r\nexception in favour of the sub-editor on press night?'\r\n\r\n“I replied that such would be contrary to my instructions.\r\n\r\n“'Oh, all right,' he answered. 'I'd like to know who's going to the\r\nRoyalty to-night, that's all. It's seven o'clock already.'\r\n\r\n“An idea occurred to me. If the sub-editor of a paper doesn't know whom\r\nto send to a theatre, it must mean that the post of dramatic critic on\r\nthat paper is for some reason or another vacant.\r\n\r\n“'Oh, that's all right,' I told him. 'I shall be in time enough.'\r\n\r\n“He appeared neither pleased nor displeased. 'Have you arranged with the\r\nGuv'nor?' he asked me.\r\n\r\n“'I'm just waiting to see him again for a few minutes,' I returned.\r\n'It'll be all right. Have you got the ticket?'\r\n\r\n“'Haven't seen it,' he replied.\r\n\r\n“'About a column?' I suggested.\r\n\r\n“'Three-quarters,' he preferred, and went.\r\n\r\n“The moment he was gone, I slipped downstairs and met a printer's boy\r\ncoming up.\r\n\r\n“'What's the name of your sub?' I asked him. 'Tall man with a black\r\nmoustache, looks tired.'\r\n\r\n“'Oh, you mean Penton,' explained the boy.\r\n\r\n“'That's the name,' I answered; 'couldn't think of it.'\r\n\r\n“I walked straight into the editor; he was still irritable. 'What is it?\r\nWhat is it now?' he snapped out.\r\n\r\n“'I only want the ticket for the Royalty Theatre,' I answered. 'Penton\r\nsays you've got it.'\r\n\r\n“'I don't know where it is,' he growled.\r\n\r\n“I found it after some little search upon his desk.\r\n\r\n“'Who's going?' he asked.\r\n\r\n“'I am,' I said. And I went.\r\n\r\n“They have never discovered to this day that I appointed myself. Penton\r\nthinks I am some relation of the proprietress, and in consequence\r\neverybody treats me with marked respect. Mrs. Wallace herself, the\r\nproprietress, thinks I am the discovery of Penton, in whose judgment\r\nshe has great faith; and with her I get on admirably. The paper I\r\ndon't think is doing too well, and the salary is small, but sufficient.\r\nJournalism suits my temperament, and I dare say I shall keep to it.”\r\n\r\n“You've been somewhat of a rolling stone hitherto,” I commented.\r\n\r\nHe laughed. “From the stone's point of view,” he answered, “I never\r\ncould see the advantage of being smothered in moss. I should always\r\nprefer remaining the stone, unhidden, able to move and see about me. But\r\nnow, to speak of other matters, what are your plans for the immediate\r\nfuture? Your opera, thanks to the gentlemen, the gods have dubbed\r\n'Goggles,' will, I fancy, run through the winter. Are you getting any\r\nsalary?”\r\n\r\n“Thirty shillings a week,” I explained to him, “with full salary for\r\nmatinees.”\r\n\r\n“Say two pounds,” he replied. “With my three we could set up an\r\nestablishment of our own. I have an idea that is original. Shall we work\r\nit out together?”\r\n\r\nI assured him with fervour that nothing would please me better.\r\n\r\n“There are four delightful rooms in Queen's Square,” he continued. “They\r\nare charmingly furnished: a fine sitting-room in the front, with\r\ntwo bedrooms and a kitchen behind. Their last tenant was a Polish\r\nRevolutionary, who, three months ago, poor fellow, was foolish enough to\r\nventure back to Russia, and who is now living rent free. The landlord of\r\nthe house is an original old fellow, Deleglise the engraver. He occupies\r\nthe rest of the house himself. He has told me I can have the rooms for\r\nanything I like to offer, and I should suggest thirty shillings a week,\r\nthough under ordinary circumstances they would be worth three or four\r\npounds. But he will only let us have them on the understanding that\r\nwe 'do for' ourselves. He is quite an oddity. He hates petticoats,\r\nespecially elderly petticoats. He has one servant, an old Frenchwoman,\r\nwho, I believe, was housekeeper to his mother, and he and she do the\r\nhousework together, most of their time quarrelling over it. Nothing else\r\nof the genus domestic female will he allow inside the door; not even an\r\noccasional charwoman would be permitted to us. On the other hand, it\r\nis a beautiful old Georgian house, with Adams mantelpieces, a stone\r\nstaircase, and oak-panelled rooms; and our portion would be the entire\r\nsecond floor: no pianos and no landlady. He is a widower with one child,\r\na girl of about fourteen or maybe a little older. Now, what do you say?\r\nI am a very fair cook; will you be house-and-parlour-maid?”\r\n\r\nI needed no pressing. A week later we were", " beautiful old Georgian house, with Adams mantelpieces, a stone\r\nstaircase, and oak-panelled rooms; and our portion would be the entire\r\nsecond floor: no pianos and no landlady.

A week later we were installed there, and for\r\nnearly two years we lived there. At the risk of offending an adorable\r\nbut somewhat touchy sex, convinced that man, left to himself, is\r\ncapable of little more than putting himself to bed, and that only in\r\na rough-and-ready fashion, truth compels me to record the fact that\r\nwithout female assistance or supervision of any kind we passed through\r\nthose two years, and yet exist to tell the tale. Dan had not idly\r\nboasted. Better plain cooking I never want to taste; so good a cup of\r\ncoffee, omelette, or devilled kidney I rarely have tasted. Had he always\r\nconfined his efforts within the boundaries of his abilities, there\r\nwould be little to record beyond continuous and monotonous success.\r\nBut stirred into dangerous ambition at the call of an occasional tea or\r\nsupper party, lured out of his depths by the example of old Deleglise,\r\nour landlord--a man who for twenty years had made cooking his hobby--Dan\r\nwould at intervals venture upon experiment. Pastry, it became evident,\r\nwas a thing he should never have touched: his hand was heavy and\r\nhis temperament too serious. There was a thing called lemon sponge,\r\nnecessitating much beating of eggs. In the cookery-book--a remarkably\r\nfat volume, luscious with illustrations of highly-coloured food--it\r\nappeared an airy and graceful structure of dazzling whiteness. Served as\r\nDan sent it to table, it suggested rather in form and colour a miniature\r\nearthquake. Spongy it undoubtedly was. One forced it apart with the\r\nassistance of one's spoon and fork; it yielded with a gentle tearing\r\nsound. Another favourite dainty of his was manna-cake. Concerning it\r\nI would merely remark that if it in any way resembled anything the\r\nChildren of Israel were compelled to eat, then there is explanation\r\nfor that fretfulness and discontent for which they have been, perhaps,\r\nunjustly blamed--some excuse even for their backward-flung desires in\r\nthe direction of the Egyptian fleshpots. Moses himself may have been\r\nblessed with exceptional digestion. It was substantial, one must say\r\nthat for it. One slice of it--solid, firm, crusty on the outside,\r\ntowards the centre marshy--satisfied most people to a sense of\r\nrepletion. For supper parties Dan would essay trifles--by no means open\r\nto the criticism of being light as air--souffle's that guests, in spite\r\nof my admonishing kicks, would persist in alluding to as pudding; and in\r\nwinter-time, pancakes. Later, as regards these latter, he acquired some\r\nskill; but at first the difficulty was the tossing. I think myself a\r\nsafer plan would have been to turn them by the aid of a knife and fork;\r\nit is less showy, but more sure. At least, you avoid all danger of\r\ncatching the half-baked thing upon your head instead of in the pan,\r\nof dropping it into the fire, or among the cinders. But “Thorough” was\r\nalways Dan's motto; and after all, small particles of coal or a few\r\nhairs can always be detected by the careful feeder, and removed.\r\n\r\nA more even-tempered man than Dan for twenty-three hours out of every\r\ntwenty-four surely never breathed. It was a revelation to me to discover\r\nthat for the other he could be uncertain, irritable, even ungrateful.\r\nAt first, in a spirit of pure good nature, I would offer him counsel and\r\nadvice; explain to him why, as it seemed to me, the custard was pimply,\r\nthe mayonnaise sauce suggestive of hair oil. What was my return? Sneers,\r\ninsult and abuse, followed, if I did not clear out quickly, by spoilt\r\ntomatoes, cold coffee grounds--anything that happened to be handy.\r\nPained, saddened, I would withdraw, he would kick the door to after me.\r\nHis greatest enemy appeared to be the oven. The oven it was that set\r\nitself to thwart his best wrought schemes. Always it was the oven's\r\nfault that the snowy bun appeared to have been made of red sandstone,\r\nthe macaroni cheese of Cambrian clay. One might have sympathised with\r\nhim more had his language been more restrained. As it was, the virulence\r\nof his reproaches almost inclined one to take the part of the oven.\r\n\r\nConcerning our house-maid, I can speak in terms of unqualified praise.\r\nThere are, alas, fussy house-maids--who has not known and suffered\r\nthem?--who overdo the thing, have no repose, no instinct telling\r\nthem when to ease up and let the place alone. I have always held the\r\nperpetual stirring up of dust a scientific error; left to itself, it is\r\nharmless, may even be regarded as a delicate domestic bloom, bestowing\r\na touch of homeliness upon objects that without it gleam cold and\r\nunsympathetic. Let sleeping dogs lie. Why be continually waking up the\r\nstuff, filling the air with all manner of unhealthy germs? Nature in her\r\ninfinite wisdom has ordained that upon table, floor, or picture frame it\r\nshall sink and settle. There it remains, quiet and inoffensive; there it\r\nwill continue to remain so long as nobody interferes with it: why worry\r\nit? So also with crumbs, odd bits of string, particles of egg-shell,\r\nstumps of matches, ends of cigarettes: what fitter place for such than\r\nunder the nearest mat? To sweep them up is tiresome work. They cling to\r\nthe carpet, you get cross with them, curse them for their obstinacy,\r\nand feel ashamed of yourself for your childishness. For every one you\r\ndo persuade into the dust-pan, two jump out again. You lose your temper,\r\nfeel bitter towards the man that dropped them. Your whole character\r\nbecomes deteriorated. Under the mat they are always willing to go.\r\nCompromise is true statesmanship. There will come a day when you will\r\nbe glad of an excuse for not doing something else that you ought to\r\nbe doing. Then you can take up the mats and feel quite industrious,\r\ncontemplating the amount of work that really must be done--some time or\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nTo differentiate between the essential and the non-essential, that\r\nis where woman fails. In the name of common sense, what is the use of\r\nwashing a cup that half an hour later is going to be made dirty again?\r\nIf the cat be willing and able to so clean a plate that not one speck of\r\ngrease remain upon it, why deprive her of pleasure to inflict toil upon\r\nyourself? If a bed looks made and feels made, then for all practical\r\npurposes it is made; why upset it merely to put it straight again? It\r\nwould surprise most women the amount of labour that can be avoided in a\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nFor needlework, I confess, I never acquired skill. Dan had learnt to\r\nhandle a thimble, but my own second finger was ever reluctant to come\r\nforward when wanted. It had to be found, all other fingers removed out\r\nof its way. Then, feebly, nervously, it would push, slip, get itself\r\npricked badly with the head of the needle, and, thoroughly frightened,\r\nremain incapable of further action. More practical I found it to push\r\nthe needle through by help of the door or table.\r\n\r\nThe opera, as Dan had predicted, ran far into the following year. When\r\nit was done with, another--in which “Goggles” appeared as one of the\r\nprincipals--took its place, and was even more successful. After the\r\nexperience of Nelson Square, my present salary of thirty-five shillings,\r\noccasionally forty shillings, a week seemed to me princely. There\r\nfloated before my eyes the possibility of my becoming a great opera\r\nsinger. On six hundred pounds a week, I felt", " the following year.

There\r\nfloated before my eyes the possibility of my becoming a great opera\r\nsinger. On six hundred pounds a week, I felt I could be content. But the\r\nO'Kelly set himself to dispel this dream.\r\n\r\n“Ye'd be making a mistake, me boy,” explained the O'Kelly. “Ye'd be just\r\nwasting ye're time. I wouldn't tell ye so if I weren't convinced of it.”\r\n\r\n“I know it is not powerful,” I admitted.\r\n\r\n“Ye might almost call it thin,” added the O'Kelly.\r\n\r\n“It might be good enough for comic opera,” I argued. “People appear to\r\nsucceed in comic opera without much voice.\r\n\r\n“Sure, there ye're right,” agreed the O'Kelly, with a sigh. “An' of\r\ncourse if ye had an exceptionally fine presence and were strikingly\r\nhandsome--”\r\n\r\n“One can do a good deal with make-up,” I suggested.\r\n\r\nThe O'Kelly shook his head. “It's never quite the same thing. It would\r\ndepend upon your acting.”\r\n\r\nI dreamt of becoming a second Kean, of taking Macready's place. It need\r\nnot interfere with my literary ambition. I could combine the two: fill\r\nDrury Lane in the evening, turn out epoch-making novels in the morning,\r\nwrite my own plays.\r\n\r\nEvery day I studied in the reading-room of the British Museum. Wearying\r\nof success in Art, I might eventually go into Parliament: a Prime\r\nMinister with a thorough knowledge of history: why not? With Ollendorf\r\nfor guide, I continued French and German. It might be the diplomatic\r\nservice that would appeal to me in my old age. An ambassadorship! It\r\nwould be a pleasant termination to a brilliant career.\r\n\r\nThere was excuse for my optimistic mood about this period. All things\r\nwere going well with me. A story of mine had been accepted. I forget for\r\nthe moment the name of the journal: it is dead now. Most of the papers\r\nin which my early efforts appeared are dead. My contributions might\r\nbe likened to their swan songs. Proofs had been sent me, which I had\r\ncorrected and returned. But proofs are not facts. This had happened to\r\nme once before, and I had been lifted to the skies only to fall the more\r\nheavily. The paper had collapsed before my story had appeared. (Ah, why\r\nhad they delayed? It might have saved them!) This time I remembered the\r\nproverb, and kept my own counsel, slipping out early each morning on the\r\nday of publication to buy the paper, to scan eagerly its columns. For\r\nweeks I suffered hope deferred. But at last, one bright winter's day in\r\nJanuary, walking down the Harrow Road, I found myself standing still,\r\nsuddenly stunned, before a bill outside a small news-vendor's shop. It\r\nwas the first time I had seen my real name in print: “The Witch of Moel\r\nSarbod: a legend of Mona, by Paul Kelver.” (For this I had even risked\r\ndiscovery by the Lady 'Ortensia.) My legs trembling under me, I entered\r\nthe shop. A ruffianly-looking man in dirty shirt-sleeves, who appeared\r\nastonished that any one should want a copy, found one at length on\r\nthe floor underneath the counter. With it in my pocket, I retraced my\r\nfootsteps as in a dream. On a seat in Paddington Green I sat down and\r\nread it. The hundred best books! I have waded through them all; they\r\nhave never charmed me as charmed me that one short story in that now\r\nforgotten journal. Need I add it was a sad and sentimental composition.\r\nOnce upon a time there lived a mighty King; one--but with the names I\r\nwill not bore you; they are somewhat unpronounceable. Their selection\r\nhad cost me many hours of study in the British Museum reading-rooms,\r\nsurrounded by lexicons of the Welsh language, gazetteers, translations\r\nfrom the early Celtic poets--with footnotes. He loved and was beloved by\r\na beautiful Princess, whose name, being translated, was Purity. One\r\nday the King, hunting, lost his way, and being weary, lay down and fell\r\nasleep. And by chance the spot whereon he lay was near to a place which\r\nby infinite pains, with the aid of a magnifying glass, I had discovered\r\nupon the map, and which means in English the Cave of the Waters, where\r\ndwelt a wicked Sorceress, who, while he slept, cast her spells upon him,\r\nso that he awoke to forget his kingly honour and the good of all his\r\npeople, his only desire being towards the Witch of Moel Sarbod.\r\n\r\nNow, there lived in this Kingdom by the sea a great Magician; and\r\nPurity, who loved the King far better than herself, bethought her of\r\nhim, and of all she had heard concerning his power and wisdom; and went\r\nto him and besought his aid that she might save the King. There was but\r\none way to accomplish this: with bare feet Purity must climb the rocky\r\npath leading to the Witch's dwelling, go boldly up to her, not fearing\r\nher sharp claws nor her strong teeth, and kiss her upon the mouth. In\r\nthis way the spirit of Purity would pass into the Witch's soul, and she\r\nwould become a woman. But the form and spirit of the Witch would pass\r\ninto Purity, transforming her, and in the Cave of the Waters she must\r\nforever abide. Thus Purity gave herself that the King might live. With\r\nbleeding feet she climbed the rocky path, clasped the Witch's form\r\nwithin her arms, kissed her on the mouth. And the Witch became a woman\r\nand reigned with the King over his people, wisely and helpfully. But\r\nPurity became a hideous witch, and to this day abides on Moel Sarbod,\r\nwhere is the Cave of the Waters. And they who climb the mountain's side\r\nstill hear above the roaring of the cataract the sobbing of Purity,\r\nthe King's betrothed. But many liken it rather to a joyous song of love\r\ntriumphant.\r\n\r\nNo writer worth his salt was ever satisfied with anything he ever wrote,\r\nso I have been told, and so I try to believe. Evidently I am not worth\r\nmy salt. Candid friends, and others, to whom in my salad days I used\r\nto show my work, asking for a frank opinion, meaning, of course, though\r\nnever would they understand me, their unadulterated praise, would assure\r\nme for my good, that this, my first to whom the gods gave life, was but\r\na feeble, ill-shaped child: its attempted early English a cross between\r\n“The Pilgrim's Progress” and “Old Moore's Almanac;” its scenery--which\r\nhad cost me weeks of research--an apparent attempt to sum up in the\r\nlanguage of a local guide book the leading characteristics of the Garden\r\nof Eden combined with Dante's Inferno; its pathos of the penny-plain\r\nand two-penny-coloured order. Maybe they were right. Much have I written\r\nsince that at the time appeared to me good, that I have read later\r\nwith regret, with burning cheek, with frowning brow. But of this, my\r\nfirst-born, the harbinger of all my hopes, I am no judge. Touching the\r\nyellowing, badly-printed pages, I feel again the deep thrill of joy with\r\nwhich I first unfolded them and read. Again I am a youngster, and life\r\nopens out before me--inmeasurable, no goal too high. This child of my\r\nbrain, my work: it shall spread my name throughout the world. It shall\r\nbe a household world in lands that I shall never see. Friends whose\r\nvoices I shall never hear will speak of me. I shall die, but it shall\r\nlive, yield fresh seed, bear fruit I know not of. Generations yet unborn\r\nshall read it and remember me. My thoughts, my words", "\r\nopens out before me--inmeasurable, no goal too high. This child of my\r\nbrain, my work: it shall spread my name throughout the world.

My thoughts, my words, my spirit: in it I\r\nshall live again; it shall keep my memory green.\r\n\r\nThe long, long thoughts of boyhood! We elders smile at them. The\r\nlittle world spins round; the little voices of an hour sink hushed. The\r\ncrawling generations come and go. The solar system drops from space. The\r\neternal mechanism reforms and shapes itself anew. Time, turning, ploughs\r\nanother furrow. So, growing sleepy, we murmur with a yawn. Is it that\r\nwe see clearer, or that our eyes are growing dim? Let the young men\r\nsee their visions, dream their dreams, hug to themselves their hopes of\r\nenduring fame; so shall they serve the world better.\r\n\r\nI brushed the tears from my eyes and looked up. Half-a-dozen urchins,\r\nmale and female, were gaping at me open-mouthed. They scattered\r\nshouting, whether compliment or insult I know not: probably the latter.\r\nI flung them a handful of coppers, which for the moment silenced them;\r\nand went upon my way. How bright, how fair the bustling streets, golden\r\nin the winter sunshine, thronged with life, with effort! Laughter rang\r\naround me. Sweet music rolled from barrel-organs. The strenuous voices\r\nof the costermongers called invitation to the fruitful earth. Errand\r\nboys passed me whistling shrilly joyous melodies. Perspiring tradesmen\r\nshouted generous offers to the needy. Men and women hurried by with\r\nsmiling faces. Sleek cats purred in sheltered nooks, till merry dogs\r\ninvited them to sport. The sparrows, feasting in the roadway, chirped\r\ntheir hymn of praise.\r\n\r\nAt the Marble Arch I jumped upon a 'bus. I mentioned to the conductor\r\nin mounting that it was a fine day. He replied that he had noticed it\r\nhimself. The retort struck me as a brilliant repartee. Our coachman, all\r\nbut run into by a hansom cab driven by a surly old fellow of patriarchal\r\nappearance, remarked upon the danger of allowing horses out in charge of\r\nbits of boys. How full the world of wit and humour!\r\n\r\nAlmost without knowing it, I found myself in earnest conversation with\r\na young man sitting next to me. We conversed of life, of love. Not until\r\nafterwards, reflecting upon the matter, did it surprise me that to a\r\nmere chance acquaintance of the moment he had spoken of the one thing\r\ndearest to his heart: a sweet but clearly wayward maiden, the Hebe of\r\na small, old-fashioned coffee-shop the 'bus was at that moment passing.\r\nHitherto I had not been the recipient of confidences. It occurred to me\r\nthat as a rule not even my friends spoke much to me concerning their\r\nown affairs; generally it was I who spoke to them of mine. I sympathised\r\nwith him, advised him--how, I do not recollect. He said, however, he\r\nthought that I was right; and at Regent Street he left me, expressing\r\nhis determination to follow my counsel, whatever it may have been.\r\n\r\nBetween Berners Street and the Circus I lent a shilling to a couple of\r\nyoung ladies who had just discovered with amusement, quickly swallowed\r\nby despair, that they neither of them had any money with them. (They\r\nreturned it next day in postage stamps, with a charming note.) The\r\nassurance with which I tendered the slight service astonished me myself.\r\nAt any other time I should have hesitated, argued with my fears, offered\r\nit with an appearance of sulky constraint, and been declined. For\r\na moment they were doubtful, then, looking at me, accepted with a\r\ndelightful smile. They consulted me as to the way to Paternoster Row.\r\nI instructed them, adding a literary anecdote, which seemed to interest\r\nthem. I even ventured on a compliment, neatly phrased, I am inclined to\r\nthink. Evidently it pleased--a result hitherto unusual in the case of\r\nmy compliments. At the corner of Southampton Row I parted from them with\r\nregret. Why had I never noticed before how full of pleasant people this\r\nsweet and smiling London?\r\n\r\nAt the corner of Queen's Square a decent-looking woman stopped me to ask\r\nthe way to the Children's Hospital at Chelsea, explaining she had made a\r\nmistake, thinking it was the one in Great Ormond Street where her child\r\nlay. I directed her, then glancing into her face, noticed how tired\r\nshe looked, and a vista of the weary pavements she would have to tramp\r\nflashed before me. I slipped some money into her hand and told her to\r\ntake a 'bus. She flushed, then thanked me. I turned a few yards further\r\non; she was starting after me, amazement on her face. I laughed and\r\nwaved my hand to her. She smiled back in return, and went her way.\r\n\r\nA rain began to fall. I paused upon the doorstep for a minute, enjoying\r\nthe cool drops upon by upturned face, the tonic sharpness of the keen\r\neast wind; then slipped my key into the lock and entered.\r\n\r\nThe door of old Deleglise's studio on the first floor happened to be\r\nopen. Hitherto, beyond the usual formal salutations, when by chance we\r\nmet upon the stairs, I had exchanged but few words with my eccentric\r\nlandlord; but remembering his kindly face, the desire came upon me\r\nto tell him my good fortune. I felt sure his eyes would lighten with\r\ndelight. By instinct I knew him for a young man's man.\r\n\r\nI tapped lightly; no answer came. Someone was talking; it sounded like a\r\ngirl's voice. I pushed the door further open and walked in; such was the\r\ncustom of the house. It was a large room, built over the yard, lighted\r\nby one high window, before which was the engraving desk, shaded under\r\na screen of tissue paper. At the further end of the room stood a large\r\ncheval-glass, and in front of this, its back towards me, was a figure\r\nthat excited my curiosity; so that remaining where I was, partly hidden\r\nbehind a large easel, I watched it for awhile in silence. Above a\r\nheavily flounced blue skirt, which fell in creases on the floor\r\nand trailed a couple of yards or so behind, it wore a black low-cut\r\nsleeveless bodice--much too big for it--of the fashion early Victorian.\r\nA good deal of dark-brown hair, fastened up by hair-pins that stuck out\r\nin all directions like quills upon a porcupine, suggesting collapse with\r\nevery movement, was ornamented by three enormous green feathers, one\r\nof which hung limply over the lady's left ear. Three times, while I\r\nwatched, unnoticed, the lady propped it into a more befitting attitude,\r\nand three times, limp and intoxicated-looking, it fell back into its\r\nformer foolish position. Her long, thin arms, displaying a pair of\r\nbrilliantly red elbows, pointed to quite a dangerous degree, terminated\r\nin hands so very sunburnt as to convey the impression of a pair of\r\nremarkably well-fitting gloves. Her right hand grasped and waved with\r\ndetermination a large lace fan, her left clutched fiercely the front of\r\nher skirt. With a sweeping curtsey to herself in the glass, which would\r\nhave been more effective could she have avoided tying her legs together\r\nwith her skirt--a _contretemps_ necessitating the use of both hands and\r\na succession of jumps before she could disentangle herself--she remarked\r\nso soon as she had recovered her balance:\r\n\r\n“So sorry I am late. My carriage was unfortunately delayed.”\r\n\r\nThe excuse, I gathered, was accepted, for with a gracious smile and\r\na vigorous bow, by help of which every hairpin made distinct further\r\nadvance towards freedom, she turned, and with much dignity and head\r\n", "with her skirt--a _contretemps_ necessitating the use of both hands and\r\na succession of jumps before she could disentangle herself--she remarked\r\nso soon as she had recovered her balance:\r\n\r\n“So sorry I am late.

At the end of six\r\nshort steps she stopped and began kicking. For what reason, I, at first,\r\ncould not comprehend. It dawned upon me after awhile that her object\r\nwas the adjustment of her train. Finding the manoeuvre too difficult of\r\naccomplishment by feet alone, she stooped, and, taking the stuff up in\r\nher hands, threw it behind her. Then, facing north, she retraced\r\nher steps to the glass, talking to herself, as she walked, in the\r\nhigh-pitched drawl, distinctive, as my stage knowledge told me, of\r\naristocratic society.\r\n\r\n“Oh, do you think so--really? Ah, yes; you say that. Certainly not! I\r\nshouldn't think of it.” There followed what I am inclined to believe was\r\nintended for a laugh, musical but tantalising. If so, want of practice\r\nmarred the effort. The performance failed to satisfy even herself. She\r\ntried again; it was still only a giggle.\r\n\r\nBefore the glass she paused, and with a haughty inclination of her head\r\nsucceeded for the third time in displacing the intoxicated feather.\r\n\r\n“Oh, bother the silly thing!” she said in a voice so natural as to be,\r\nby contrast with her previous tone, quite startling.\r\n\r\nShe fixed it again with difficulty, muttering something inarticulate.\r\nThen, her left hand resting on an imaginary coat-sleeve, her right\r\nholding her skirt sufficiently high to enable her to move, she commenced\r\nto majestically gyrate.\r\n\r\nWhether, hampered as she was by excess of skirt, handicapped by the\r\nnatural clumsiness of her age, catastrophe in any case would not sooner\r\nor later have overtaken her, I have my doubts. I have since learnt her\r\nown view to be that but for catching sight, in turning, of my face,\r\nstaring at her through the bars of the easel, all would have gone well\r\nand gracefully. Avoiding controversy on this point, the facts to be\r\nrecorded are, that, seeing me, she uttered a sudden exclamation of\r\nsurprise, dropped her skirt, trod on her train, felt her hair coming\r\ndown, tried to do two things at once, and sat upon the floor. I ran to\r\nher assistance. With flaming face and flashing eyes she sprang to her\r\nfeet. There was a sound as of the rushing down of avalanches. The blue\r\nflounced skirt lay round her on the floor. She stood above its billowy\r\nfolds, reminiscent of Venus rising from the waves--a gawky, angular\r\nVenus in a short serge frock, reaching a little below her knees, black\r\nstockings and a pair of prunella boots of a size suggesting she had yet\r\nsome inches to grow before reaching her full height.\r\n\r\n“I hope you haven't hurt yourself,” I said.\r\n\r\nThe next moment I didn't care whether she had or whether she hadn't.\r\nShe did not reply to my kindly meant enquiry. Instead, her hand swept\r\nthrough the air in the form of an ample semi-circle. It terminated on\r\nmy ear. It was not a small hand; it was not a soft hand; it was not\r\nthat sort of hand. The sound of the contact rang through the room like a\r\npistol shot; I heard it with my other ear. I sprang at her, and catching\r\nher before she had recovered her equilibrium, kissed her. I did not kiss\r\nher because I wanted to. I kissed her because I could not box her ears\r\nback in return, which I should have preferred doing. I kissed her,\r\nhoping it would make her mad. It did. If a look could have killed me,\r\nsuch would have been the tragic ending of this story. It did not kill\r\nme; it did me good.\r\n\r\n“You horrid boy!” she cried. “You horrid, horrid boy!”\r\n\r\nThere, I admit, she scored. I did not in the least object to her\r\nthinking me horrid, but at nineteen one does object to being mistaken\r\nfor a boy.\r\n\r\n“I am not a boy,” I explained.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you are,” she retorted; “a beast of a boy!”\r\n\r\n“If you do it again,” I warned her--a sudden movement on her part\r\nhinting to me the possibility--“I'll kiss you again! I mean it.”\r\n\r\n“Leave the room!” she commanded, pointing with her angular arm towards\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nI did not wish to remain. I was about to retire with as much dignity as\r\ncircumstances permitted.\r\n\r\n“Boy!” she added.\r\n\r\nAt that I turned. “Now I won't go!” I replied. “See if I do.”\r\n\r\nWe stood glaring at each other.\r\n\r\n“What right have you in here?” she demanded.\r\n\r\n“I came to see Mr. Deleglise,” I answered. “I suppose you are Miss\r\nDeleglise. It doesn't seem to me that you know how to treat a visitor.”\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Horace Moncrieff,” I replied. I was using at the period both my\r\nnames indiscriminately, but for this occasion Horace Moncrieff I judged\r\nthe more awe-inspiring.\r\n\r\nShe snorted. “I know. You're the house-maid. You sweep all the crumbs\r\nunder the mats.”\r\n\r\nNow this was a subject about which at the time I was feeling somewhat\r\nsore. “Needs must when the Devil drives;” but as matters were, Dan and I\r\ncould well have afforded domestic assistance. It rankled in my mind that\r\nto fit in with the foolish fad of old Deleglise, I the future Dickens,\r\nThackeray and George Eliot, Kean, Macready and Phelps rolled into one,\r\nshould be compelled to the performance of menial duties. On this morning\r\nof all others, my brilliant literary career just commenced, the anomaly\r\nof the thing appeared naturally more glaring.\r\n\r\nBesides, how came she to know I swept the crumbs under the mat--that it\r\nwas my method? Had she and Dan been discussing me, ridiculing me behind\r\nmy back? What right had Dan to reveal the secrets of our menage to this\r\nchit of a school-girl? Had he done so? or had she been prying, poking\r\nher tilted nose into matters that did not concern her? Pity it was she\r\nhad no mother to occasionally spank her, teach her proper behaviour.\r\n\r\n“Where I sweep our crumbs is nothing to do with you,” I replied with\r\nsome spirit. “That I have to sweep them at all is the fault of your\r\nfather. A sensible girl--”\r\n\r\n“How dare you speak against my father!” she interrupted me with blazing\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“We will not discuss the question further,” I answered, with sense and\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n“I think you had better not!” she retorted.\r\n\r\nTurning her back on me, she commenced to gather up her hairpins--there\r\nmust have been about a hundred of them. I assisted her to the extent of\r\npicking up about twenty, which I handed to her with a bow: it may have\r\nbeen a little stiff, but that was only to be expected. I wished to show\r\nher that her bad example had not affected my own manners.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry my presence should have annoyed you,” I said. “It was quite\r\nan accident. I entered the room thinking your father was here.”\r\n\r\n“When you saw he wasn't, you might have gone out again,” she replied,\r\n“instead of hiding yourself behind a picture.”\r\n\r\n“I didn't hide myself,” I explained. “The easel happened to be in the\r\nway.”\r\n\r\n“And you stopped there and watched me.”\r\n\r\n“I couldn't help it.”\r\n\r\nShe looked round and our eyes met. They were frank, grey eyes. An\r\nexpression of merriment shot into them. I laughed.\r\n\r\nThen she laughed: it was a delightful laugh, the laugh one would have\r\nexpected from her.\r\n\r\n“You might at least have coughed,” she suggested.\r\n\r\n“It was so amusing,”", " hide myself,” I explained. “The easel happened to be in the\r\nway.”\r\n\r\n“And you stopped there and watched me.”\r\n\r\n“I couldn't help it.”\r\n\r\nShe looked round and our eyes met. They were frank, grey eyes. An\r\nexpression of merriment shot into them. I laughed.\r\n\r\nThen she laughed: it was a delightful laugh, the laugh one would have\r\nexpected from her.\r\n\r\n“You might at least have coughed,” she suggested.\r\n\r\n“It was so amusing,” I pleaded.\r\n\r\n“I suppose it was,” she agreed, and held out her hand. “Did I hurt you?”\r\n she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you did,” I answered, taking it.\r\n\r\n“Well, it was enough to annoy me, wasn't it?” she suggested.\r\n\r\n“Evidently,” I agreed.\r\n\r\n“I am going to a ball next week,” she explained, “a grown-up ball, and\r\nI've got to wear a skirt. I wanted to see if I could manage a train.”\r\n\r\n“Well, to be candid, you can't,” I assured her.\r\n\r\n“It does seem difficult.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I show you?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“What do you know about it?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I see it done every night.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; of course, you're on the stage. Yes, do.”\r\n\r\nWe readjusted the torn skirt, accommodating it better to her figure by\r\nthe help of hairpins. I showed her how to hold the train, and, I humming\r\na tune, we commenced to waltz.\r\n\r\n“I shouldn't count my steps,” I suggested to her. “It takes your mind\r\naway from the music.”\r\n\r\n“I don't waltz well,” she admitted meekly. “I know I don't do anything\r\nwell--except play hockey.”\r\n\r\n“And try not to tread on your partner's feet. That's a very bad fault.”\r\n\r\n“I do try not to,” she explained.\r\n\r\n“It comes with practice,” I assured her.\r\n\r\n“I'll get Tom to give me half an hour every evening,” she said. “He\r\ndances beautifully.”\r\n\r\n“Who's Tom?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, father.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you call your father Tom? It doesn't sound respectful.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he likes it; and it suits him so much better than father. Besides,\r\nhe isn't like a real father. He does everything I want him to.”\r\n\r\n“Is that good for you?”\r\n\r\n“No; it's very bad for me--everybody says so. When you come to think of\r\nit, of course it isn't the way to bring up a girl. I tell him, but he\r\nmerely laughs--says it's the only way he knows. I do hope I turn out all\r\nright. Am I doing it better now?”\r\n\r\n“A little. Don't be too anxious about it. Don't look at your feet.”\r\n\r\n“But if I don't they go all wrong. It was you who trod on mine that\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“I know. I'm sorry. It's a little difficult not to.”\r\n\r\n“Am I holding my train all right?”\r\n\r\n“Well, there's no need to grip it as if you were afraid it would run\r\naway. It will follow all right. Hold it gracefully.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I wasn't a girl.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you'll get used to it.” We concluded our dance.\r\n\r\n“What do I do--say 'Thank you'?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, prettily.”\r\n\r\n“What does he do?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he takes you back to your chaperon, or suggests refreshment, or you\r\nsit and talk.”\r\n\r\n“I hate talking. I never know what to say.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that's his duty. He'll try and amuse you, then you must laugh. You\r\nhave a nice laugh.”\r\n\r\n“But I never know when to laugh. If I laugh when I want to it always\r\noffends people. What do you do if somebody asks you to dance and you\r\ndon't want to dance with them?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you say your programme is full.”\r\n\r\n“But if it isn't?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you tell a lie.”\r\n\r\n“Couldn't I say I don't dance well, and that I'm sure they'd get on\r\nbetter with somebody else?”\r\n\r\n“It would be the truth, but they might not believe it.”\r\n\r\n“I hope nobody asks me that I don't want.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he won't a second time, anyhow.”\r\n\r\n“You are rude.”\r\n\r\n“You are only a school-girl.”\r\n\r\n“I look a woman in my new frock, I really do.”\r\n\r\n“I should doubt it.”\r\n\r\n“You shall see me, then you'll be polite. It is because you are a boy\r\nyou are rude. Men are much nicer.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, are they?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. You will be, when you are a man.”\r\n\r\nThe sound of voices rose suddenly in the hall.\r\n\r\n“Tom!” cried Miss Deleglise; and collecting her skirt in both hands,\r\nbolted down the corkscrew staircase leading to the kitchen, leaving me\r\nstanding in the centre of the studio.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and old Deleglise entered, accompanied by a small,\r\nslight man with red hair and beard and somewhat watery eyes.\r\n\r\nDeleglise himself was a handsome old fellow, then a man of about\r\nfifty-five. His massive, mobile face, illuminated by bright, restless\r\neyes, was crowned with a lion-like mane of iron-grey hair. Till a few\r\nyears ago he had been a painter of considerable note. But in questions\r\nof art his temper was short. Pre-Raphaelism had gone out of fashion for\r\nthe time being; the tendency of the new age was towards impressionism,\r\nand in disgust old Deleglise had broken his palette across his knee, and\r\nswore never to paint again. Artistic work of some sort being necessary\r\nto his temperament, he contented himself now with engraving. At the\r\nmoment he was engaged upon the reproduction of Memlinc's Shrine of St.\r\nUrsula, with photographs of which he had just returned from Bruges.\r\n\r\nAt sight of me his face lighted with a smile, and he advanced with\r\noutstretched hand.\r\n\r\n“Ah; my lad, so you have got over your shyness and come to visit the old\r\nbear in his den. Good boy. I like young faces.”\r\n\r\nHe had a clear, musical voice, ever with the suggestion of a laugh\r\nbehind it. He laid his hand upon my shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Why, you are looking as if you had come into a fortune,” he added, “and\r\ndidn't know what a piece of bad luck that can be to a young fellow like\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n“How could it be bad luck?” I asked, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Takes all the sauce out of life, young man,” answered Deleglise. “What\r\ninterest is there in running a race with the prize already in your\r\npossession, tell me that?”\r\n\r\n“It is not that kind of fortune,” I answered, “it is another. I have had\r\nmy first story accepted. It is in print. Look.”\r\n\r\nI handed him the paper. He spread it out upon the engraving board before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Ah, that's better,” he said, “that's better. Charlie,” he turned to the\r\nred-headed man, who had seated himself listlessly in the one easy-chair\r\nthe room contained, “come here.”\r\n\r\nThe red-headed man rose and wandered towards us. “Let me introduce you\r\nto Mr. Paul Kelver, our new fellow servant. Our lady has accepted him.\r\nHe has just been elected; his first story is in print.”\r\n\r\nThe red-haired man stretched out his long thin hand. “I have thirty\r\nyears of fame,” said the red-haired man--“could I say world-wide?”\r\n\r\nHe turned for confirmation to old Deleglise, who laughed. “I think you\r\ncan.”\r\n\r\n“If I could give it you would you exchange with me--at this moment?”\r\n\r\n“You would be a fool if you did,” he went on. “One's first success,\r\none's first victory! It is the lover's first kiss. Fortune grows old and\r\nwrinkled, frowns more often than she smiles. We become indifferent to\r\nher, quarrel with her, make it up again. But the joy of her first kiss\r\nafter the long wooing! Burn it into your memory, my young friend, that\r\nit may live with you always!”\r\n\r\nHe strolled away. Old Deleglise took up the parable.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes; one's first success, Paul! Laugh,", ". Fortune grows old and\r\nwrinkled, frowns more often than she smiles. We become indifferent to\r\nher, quarrel with her, make it up again. But the joy of her first kiss\r\nafter the long wooing! Burn it into your memory, my young friend, that\r\nit may live with you always!”\r\n\r\nHe strolled away. Old Deleglise took up the parable.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes; one's first success, Paul! Laugh, my boy, cry! Shut yourself\r\nup in your room, shout, dance! Throw your hat into the air and cry\r\nhurrah! Make the most of it, Paul. Hug it to your heart, think of it,\r\ndream of it. This is the finest hour of your life, my boy. There will\r\nnever come another like it--never!”\r\n\r\nHe crossed the studio, and taking from its nail a small oil painting,\r\nbrought it over and laid it on the board beside my paper. It was a\r\nfascinating little picture, painted with that exquisite minutiae and\r\ndevelopment of detail that a newer school was then ridiculing: as though\r\nArt had but one note to her voice. The dead figure of an old man lay\r\nupon a bed. A child had crept into the darkened room, and supporting\r\nitself by clutching tightly at the sheet, was gazing with solemn\r\ncuriosity upon the white, still face.\r\n\r\n“That was mine,” said old Deleglise. “It was hung in the Academy\r\nthirty-six years ago, and bought for ten guineas by a dentist at Bury\r\nSt. Edmunds. He went mad a few years later and died in a lunatic asylum.\r\nI had never lost sight of it, and the executors were quite agreeable\r\nto my having it back again for the same ten guineas. I used to go every\r\nmorning to the Academy to look at it. I thought it the cleverest bit of\r\nwork in the whole gallery, and I'm not at all sure that it wasn't. I\r\nsaw myself a second Teniers, another Millet. Look how that light coming\r\nthrough the open door is treated; isn't it good? Somebody will pay a\r\nthousand guineas for it before I have been dead a dozen years, and it\r\nis worth it. But I wouldn't sell it myself now for five thousand. One's\r\nfirst success; it is worth all the rest of life!”\r\n\r\n“All?” queried the red-haired man from his easy-chair. We looked round.\r\nThe lady of the skirt had entered, now her own proper self: a young girl\r\nof about fifteen, angular, awkward-looking, but bringing into the room\r\nwith her that atmosphere of life, of hope, that is the eternal message\r\nof youth. She was not beautiful, not then--plain one might almost have\r\ncalled her but for her frank, grey eyes, her mass of dark-brown hair\r\nnow gathered into a long thick plait. A light came into old Deleglise's\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“You are right, not all,” he murmured to the red-haired man.\r\n\r\nShe came forward shyly. I found it difficult to recognise in her the\r\nflaming Fury that a few minutes before had sprung at me from the billows\r\nof her torn blue skirt. She shook hands with the red-haired man and\r\nkissed her father.\r\n\r\n“My daughter,” said old Deleglise, introducing me to her. “Mr. Paul\r\nKelver, a literary gent.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Kelver and I have met already,” she explained. “He has been waiting\r\nfor you here in the studio.”\r\n\r\n“And have you been entertaining him?” asked Deleglise. “Oh, yes,\r\nI entertained him,” she replied. Her voice was singularly like her\r\nfather's, with just the same suggestion of ever a laugh behind it.\r\n\r\n“We entertained each other,” I said.\r\n\r\n“That's all right,” said old Deleglise. “Stop and lunch with us. We will\r\nmake ourselves a curry.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nOF THE GLORY AND GOODNESS AND THE EVIL THAT GO TO THE MAKING OF LOVE.\r\n\r\nDuring my time of struggle I had avoided all communication with old\r\nHasluck. He was not a man to sympathise with feelings he did not\r\nunderstand. With boisterous good humour he would have insisted upon\r\nhelping me. Why I preferred half starving with Lott and Co. to selling\r\nmy labour for a fair wage to good-natured old Hasluck, merely because\r\nI knew him, I cannot explain. Though the profits may not have been so\r\nlarge, Lott and Co.'s dealings were not one whit more honest: I do not\r\nbelieve it was that which decided me. Nor do I think it was because he\r\nwas Barbara's father. I never connected him, nor that good old soul,\r\nhis vulgar, homely wife, in any way with Barbara. To me she was a being\r\napart from all the world. Her true Parents! I should have sought them\r\nrather amid the sacred groves of vanished lands, within the sky-domed\r\nshrines of banished gods. There are instincts in us not easily\r\nanalysed, not to be explained by reason. I have always preferred the\r\nfinding--sometimes the losing--of my way according to the map, to the\r\nsurer and simpler method of vocal enquiry; working out a complicated\r\njourney, and running the risk of never arriving at my destination,\r\nby aid of a Continental Bradshaw, to putting myself into the hands\r\nof courteous officials maintained and paid to assist the perplexed\r\ntraveller. Possibly a far-off progenitor of mine may have been some\r\nmorose “rogue” savage with untribal inclinations, living in his\r\ncave apart, fashioning his own stone hammer, shaping his own flint\r\narrow-heads, shunning the merry war-dance, preferring to caper by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut now, having gained my own foothold, I could stretch out my hand\r\nwithout fear of the movement being mistaken for appeal. I wrote to old\r\nHasluck; and almost by the next post received from him the friendliest\r\nof notes. He told me Barbara had just returned from abroad, took it upon\r\nhimself to add that she also would be delighted to see me, and, as I\r\nknew he would, threw his doors open to me.\r\n\r\nOf my boyish passion for Barbara never had I spoken to a living soul,\r\nnor do I think, excepting Barbara herself, had any ever guessed it. To\r\nmy mother, though she was very fond of her, Barbara was only a girl,\r\nwith charms but also with faults, concerning which my mother would\r\nspeak freely; hurting me, as one unwittingly might hurt a neophyte by\r\nphilosophical discussion of his newly embraced religion. Often, choosing\r\nby preference late evening or the night, I would wander round and round\r\nthe huge red-brick house standing in its ancient garden on the top\r\nof Stamford Hill; descending again into the noisome streets as one\r\nreturning to the world from praying at a shrine, purified, filled with\r\npeace, all noble endeavour, all unselfish aims seeming within my grasp.\r\n\r\nDuring Barbara's four years' absence my adoration had grown and\r\nstrengthened. Out of my memory of her my desire had evolved its ideal; a\r\nbeing of my imagination, but by reason of that, to me the more real,\r\nthe more present. I looked forward to seeing her again, but with no\r\nimpatience, revelling rather in the anticipation than eager for the\r\nrealisation. As a creature of flesh and blood, the child I had played\r\nwith, talked with, touched, she had faded further and further into the\r\ndistance; as the vision of my dreams she stood out clearer day by day. I\r\nknew that when next I saw her there would be a gulf between us I had\r\nno wish to bridge. To worship her from afar was a sweeter thought to me\r\nthan would have been the hope of a passionate embrace. To live with her,\r\nsit opposite to her while she ate and drank, see her, perhaps, with her\r\nhair in curl-papers, know possibly that she had a corn upon her foot,\r\nhear her speak maybe of a decayed tooth, or of a chilblain, would have\r\nbeen torture to me. Into such abyss of the commonplace there was no fear\r\nof my dragging her, and for this I was glad. In", " would have been the hope of a passionate embrace.

Into such abyss of the commonplace there was no fear\r\nof my dragging her, and for this I was glad. In the future she would be\r\nyet more removed from me. She was older than I was; she must be now a\r\nwoman. Instinctively I felt that in spite of years I was not yet a man.\r\nShe would marry. The thought gave me no pain, my feeling for her was\r\nutterly devoid of appetite. No one but myself could close the temple\r\nI had built about her, none deny to me the right of entry there. No\r\njealous priest could hide her from my eyes, her altar I had reared too\r\nhigh. Since I have come to know myself better, I perceive that she stood\r\nto me not as a living woman, but as a symbol; not a fellow human being\r\nto be walked with through life, helping and to be helped, but that\r\nimpalpable religion of sex to which we raise up idols of poor human\r\nclay, alas, not always to our satisfaction, so that foolishly we fall\r\ninto anger against them, forgetting they were but the work of our own\r\nhands; not the body, but the spirit of love.\r\n\r\nI allowed a week to elapse after receiving old Hasluck's letter before\r\npresenting myself at Stamford Hill. It was late one afternoon in early\r\nsummer. Hasluck had not returned from the City, Mrs. Hasluck was out\r\nvisiting, Miss Hasluck was in the garden. I told the supercilious\r\nfootman not to trouble, I would seek her there myself. I guessed where\r\nshe would be; her favourite spot had always been a sunny corner, bright\r\nwith flowers, surrounded by a thick yew hedge, cut, after the Dutch\r\nfashion, into quaint shapes of animals and birds. She was walking there,\r\nas I had expected, reading a book. And again, as I saw her, came back\r\nto me the feeling that had swept across me as a boy, when first outlined\r\nagainst the dusty books and papers of my father's office she had flashed\r\nupon my eyes: that all the fairy tales had suddenly come true, only\r\nnow, instead of the Princess, she was the Queen. Taller she was, with\r\na dignity that formerly had been the only charm she lacked. She did not\r\nhear my coming, my way being across the soft, short grass, and for a\r\nlittle while I stood there in the shadow of the yews, drinking in the\r\nbeauty of her clear-cut profile, bent down towards her book, the curving\r\nlines of her long neck, the wonder of the exquisite white hand against\r\nthe lilac of her dress.\r\n\r\nI did not speak; rather would I have remained so watching; but turning\r\nat the end of the path, she saw me, and as she came towards me held out\r\nher hand. I knelt upon the path, and raised it to my lips. The action\r\nwas spontaneous, till afterwards I was not aware of having done it. Her\r\nlips were smiling as I raised my eyes to them, the faintest suggestion\r\nof contempt mingling with amusement. Yet she seemed pleased, and her\r\ncontempt, even if I were not mistaken, would not have wounded me.\r\n\r\n“So you are still in love with me? I wondered if you would be.”\r\n\r\n“Did you know that I was in love with you?”\r\n\r\n“I should have been blind if I had not.”\r\n\r\n“But I was only a boy.”\r\n\r\n“You were not the usual type of boy. You are not going to be the usual\r\ntype of man.”\r\n\r\n“You do not mind my loving you?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot help it, can I? Nor can you.”\r\n\r\nShe seated herself on a stone bench facing a sun-dial, and leaning hack,\r\nher hands clasped behind her head, looked at me and laughed.\r\n\r\n“I shall always love you,” I answered, “but it is with a curious sort of\r\nlove. I do not understand it myself.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” she commanded, still with a smile about her lips, “describe\r\nit to me.”\r\n\r\nI was standing over against her, my arm resting upon the dial's stone\r\ncolumn. The sun was sinking, casting long shadows on the velvety grass,\r\nilluminating with a golden light her upturned face.\r\n\r\n“I would you were some great queen of olden days, and that I might be\r\nalways near you, serving you, doing your bidding. Your love in return\r\nwould spoil all; I shall never ask it, never desire it. That I might\r\nlook upon you, touch now and then at rare intervals with my lips your\r\nhand, kiss in secret the glove you had let fall, the shoe you had flung\r\noff, know that you knew of my love, that I was yours to do with as you\r\nwould, to live or die according to your wish. Or that you were priestess\r\nin some temple of forgotten gods, where I might steal at daybreak and at\r\ndusk to gaze upon your beauty; kneel with clasped hands, watching your\r\nsandalled feet coming and going about the altar steps; lie with pressed\r\nlips upon the stones your trailing robes had touched.”\r\n\r\nShe laughed a light mocking laugh. “I should prefer to be the queen.\r\nThe role of priestess would not suit me. Temples are so cold.” A slight\r\nshiver passed through her. She made a movement with her hand, beckoning\r\nme to her feet. “That is how you shall love me, Paul,” she said,\r\n“adoring me, worshipping me--blindly. I will be your queen and treat\r\nyou--as it chooses me. All I think, all I do, I will tell you, and you\r\nshall tell me it is right. The queen can do no wrong.”\r\n\r\nShe took my face between her hands, and bending over me, looked long\r\nand steadfastly into my eyes. “You understand, Paul, the queen can do\r\nno wrong--never, never.” There had crept into her voice a note of\r\nvehemence, in her face was a look almost of appeal.\r\n\r\n“My queen can do no wrong,” I repeated. And she laughed and let her\r\nhands fall back upon her lap.\r\n\r\n“Now you may sit beside me. So much honour, Paul, shall you have to-day,\r\nbut it will have to last you long. And you may tell me all you have been\r\ndoing, maybe it will amuse me; and afterwards you shall hear what I have\r\ndone, and shall say that it was right and good of me.”\r\n\r\nI obeyed, sketching my story briefly, yet leaving nothing untold, not\r\neven the transit of the Lady 'Ortensia, ashamed of the episode though I\r\nwas. At that she looked a little grave.\r\n\r\n“You must do nothing again, Paul,” she commanded, “to make me feel\r\nashamed of you, or I shall dismiss you from my presence for ever. I must\r\nbe proud of you, or you shall not serve me. In dishonouring yourself you\r\nare dishonouring me. I am angry with you, Paul. Do not let me be angry\r\nwith you again.”\r\n\r\nAnd so that passed; and although my love for her--as I know well she\r\nwished and sought it should--failed to save me at all times from the\r\napish voices whispering ever to the beast within us, I know the desire\r\nto be worthy of her, to honour her with all my being, helped my life as\r\nonly love can. The glory of the morning fades, the magic veil is rent;\r\nwe see all things with cold, clear eyes. My love was a woman. She lies\r\ndead. They have mocked her white sweet limbs with rags and tatters, but\r\nthey cannot cheat love's eyes. God knows I loved her in all purity! Only\r\nwith false love we love the false. Beneath the unclean clinging garments\r\nshe sleeps fair.\r\n\r\nMy tale finished, “Now I will tell you mine,” she said. “I am going to\r\nbe married soon. I shall be a Countess, Paul, the Countess Huescar--I\r\nwill teach you how to pronounce it", " white sweet limbs with rags and tatters, but\r\nthey cannot cheat love's eyes. God knows I loved her in all purity! Only\r\nwith false love we love the false.

I shall be a Countess, Paul, the Countess Huescar--I\r\nwill teach you how to pronounce it--and I shall have a real castle in\r\nSpain. You need not look so frightened, Paul; we shall not live there.\r\nIt is a half-ruined, gloomy place, among the mountains, and he loves it\r\neven less than I do. Paris and London will be my courts, so you will\r\nsee me often. You shall know the great world, Paul, the world I mean to\r\nconquer, where I mean to rule.”\r\n\r\n“Is he very rich?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“As poor,” she laughed, “as poor as a Spanish nobleman. The money I\r\nshall have to provide, or, rather, poor dear Dad will. He gives me\r\ntitle, position. Of course I do not love him, handsome though he is.\r\nDon't look so solemn, Paul. We shall get on together well enough.\r\nQueens, Paul, do not make love matches, they contract alliances. I have\r\ndone well, Paul; congratulate me. Do you hear, Paul? Say that I have\r\nacted rightly.”\r\n\r\n“Does he love you?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“He tells me so,” she answered, with a laugh. “How uncourtier-like you\r\nare, Paul! Do you suggest that any man could see me and not love me?”\r\n\r\nShe sprang to her feet. “I do not want his love,” she cried; “it would\r\nbore me. Women hate love they cannot return. I don't mean love like\r\nyours, devout little Paul,” she added, with a laugh. “That is sweet\r\nincense wafted round us that we like to scent with our noses in the air.\r\nGive me that, Paul; I want it, I ask for it. But the love of a hand, the\r\nlove of a husband that one does not care for--it would be horrible!”\r\n\r\nI felt myself growing older. For the moment my goddess became a child\r\nneeding help.\r\n\r\n“But have you thought--” I commenced.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” she interrupted me quickly, “I have thought and thought till\r\nI can think no more. There must be some sacrifice; it must be as little\r\nas need be, that is all. He does not love me; he is marrying me for my\r\nmoney--I know that, and I am glad of it. You do not know me, Paul. I\r\nmust have rank, position. What am I? The daughter of rich old Hasluck,\r\nwho began life as a butcher in the Mile End Road. As the Princess\r\nHuescar, society will forget, as Mrs.”--it seemed to me she checked\r\nherself abruptly--“Jones or Brown it would remember, however rich\r\nI might be. I am vain, Paul, caring for power--ambition. I have my\r\nfather's blood in me. All his nights and days he has spent in gaining\r\nwealth; he can do no more. We upstarts have our pride of race. He has\r\ndone his share, I must do mine.”\r\n\r\n“But you need not be mere Mrs. anybody commonplace,” I argued. “Why not\r\nwait? You will meet someone who can give you position and whom at the\r\nsame time you can love. Would that not be better?”\r\n\r\n“He will never come, the man I could love,” she answered. “Because,\r\nmy little Paul, he has come already. Hush, Paul, the queen can do no\r\nwrong.”\r\n\r\n“Who is he?” I asked. “May I not know?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Paul,” she answered, “you shall know; I want you to know, then you\r\nshall tell me that I have acted rightly. Do you hear me, Paul?--quite\r\nrightly--that you still respect me and honour me. He could not help me.\r\nAs his wife, I should be less even than I am, a mere rich nobody, giving\r\nlong dinner-parties to other rich nobodies, living amongst City men,\r\nretired trades-people; envied only by their fat, vulgarly dressed wives,\r\ncourted by seedy Bohemians for the sake of my cook; with perhaps an\r\nopera singer or an impecunious nobleman or two out of Dad's City list\r\nfor my show-guests. Is that the court, Paul, where you would have your\r\nqueen reign?”\r\n\r\n“Is he so commonplace a man,” I answered, “the man you love? I cannot\r\nbelieve it.”\r\n\r\n“He is not commonplace,” she answered. “It is I who am commonplace. The\r\nthings I desire, they are beneath him; he will never trouble himself to\r\nsecure them.”\r\n\r\n“Not even for love of you?”\r\n\r\n“I would not have him do so even were he willing. He is great, with a\r\ngreatness I cannot even understand. He is not the man for these times.\r\nIn old days, I should have married him, knowing he would climb to\r\ngreatness by sheer strength of manhood. But now men do not climb; they\r\ncrawl to greatness. He could not do that. I have done right, Paul.”\r\n\r\n“What does he say?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Shall I tell you?” She laughed a little bitterly. “I can give you his\r\nexact words, 'You are half a woman and half a fool, so woman-like you\r\nwill follow your folly. But let your folly see to it that your woman\r\nmakes no fool of herself.'”\r\n\r\nThe words were what I could imagine his saying. I heard the strong ring\r\nof his voice through her mocking mimicry.\r\n\r\n“Hal!” I cried. “It is he.”\r\n\r\n“So you never guessed even that, Paul. I thought at times it would be\r\nsweet to cry it out aloud, that it could have made no difference, that\r\neveryone who knew me must have read it in my eyes.”\r\n\r\n“But he never seemed to take much notice of you,” I said.\r\n\r\nShe laughed. “You needn't be so unkind, Paul. What did I ever do for\r\nyou much more than snub you? We boys and girls; there is not so much\r\ndifference between us: we love our masters. Yet you must not think so\r\npoorly of me. I was only a child to him then, but we were locked up in\r\nParis together during the entire siege. Have not you heard? He did take\r\na little notice of me there, Paul, I assure you.”\r\n\r\nWould it have been better, I wonder, had she followed the woman and not\r\nthe fool? It sounds an easy question to answer; but I am thinking of\r\nyears later, one winter's night at Tiefenkasten in the Julier Pass. I\r\nwas on my way from San Moritz to Chur. The sole passenger, I had just\r\nclimbed, half frozen, from the sledge, and was thawing myself before the\r\nstove in the common room of the hotel when the waiter put a pencilled\r\nnote into my hand:\r\n\r\n“Come up and see me. I am a prisoner in this damned hole till the\r\nweather breaks. Hal.”\r\n\r\nI hardly recognised him at first. Only the poor ghost he seemed of the\r\nHal I had known as a boy. His long privations endured during the Paris\r\nsiege, added to the superhuman work he had there put upon himself, had\r\ncommenced the ruin of even his magnificent physique--a ruin the wild,\r\nloose life he was now leading was soon to complete. It was a gloomy,\r\nvaulted room that once had been a chapel, lighted dimly by a cheap,\r\nevil-smelling lamp, heated to suffocation by one of those great\r\ngreen-tiled German ovens now only to be met with in rare out-of-the-way\r\nworld corners. He was sitting propped up by pillows on the bed, placed\r\nclose to one of the high windows, his deep eyes flaring like two\r\ngleaming caverns out of his drawn, haggard face.\r\n\r\n“I saw you from the window,” he explained. “It is the only excitement\r\nI get, twice a day when the sledges come in. I broke down coming across\r\nthe", " German ovens now only to be met with in rare out-of-the-way\r\nworld corners. He was sitting propped up by pillows on the bed, placed\r\nclose to one of the high windows, his deep eyes flaring like two\r\ngleaming caverns out of his drawn, haggard face.\r\n\r\n“I saw you from the window,” he explained. “It is the only excitement\r\nI get, twice a day when the sledges come in. I broke down coming across\r\nthe Pass a fortnight ago, on my way from Davos. We were stuck in a drift\r\nfor eighteen hours; it nearly finished my last lung. And I haven't even\r\na book to read. By God! lad, I was glad to see your frosted face ten\r\nminutes ago in the light of the lantern.”\r\n\r\nHe grasped me with his long bony hand. “Sit down, and let me hear\r\nmy voice using again its mother tongue--you were always a good\r\nlistener--for the last eight years I have hardly spoken it. Can you\r\nstand the room? The windows ought to be open, but what does it matter? I\r\nmay as well get accustomed to the heat before I die.”\r\n\r\nI drew my chair close to the bed, and for awhile, between his fits\r\nof coughing, we talked of things that were outside our thoughts, or,\r\nrather, Hal talked, continuously, boisterously, meeting my remonstrances\r\nwith shouts of laughter, ending in wild struggles for breath, so that I\r\ndeemed it better to let him work his mad mood out.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly: “What is she doing?” he asked. “Do you ever see her?”\r\n\r\n“She is playing in--” I mentioned the name of a comic opera then running\r\nin Paris. “No; I have not seen her for some time.”\r\n\r\nHe laid his white, wasted hand on mine. “What a pity you and I could not\r\nhave rolled ourselves into one, Paul--you, the saint, and I, the satyr.\r\nTogether we should have made her perfect lover.”\r\n\r\nThere came back to me the memory of those long nights when I had lain\r\nawake listening to the angry voices of my father and mother soaking\r\nthrough the flimsy wall. It seemed my fate to stand thus helpless\r\nbetween those I loved, watching them hurting one another against their\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” I asked--“I loved her, knowing her: I was not blind. Whose\r\nfault was it? Yours or hers?”\r\n\r\nHe laughed. “Whose fault, Paul? God made us.”\r\n\r\nThinking of her fair, sweet face, I hated him for his mocking laugh. But\r\nthe next moment, looking into his deep eyes, seeing the pain that dwelt\r\nthere, my pity was for him. A smile came to his ugly mouth.\r\n\r\n“You have been on the stage, Paul; you must have heard the saying often:\r\n'Ah, well, the curtain must come down, however badly things are going.'\r\nIt is only a play, Paul. We do not choose our parts. I did not even\r\nknow I was the villain, till I heard the booing of the gallery. I even\r\nthought I was the hero, full of noble sentiment, sacrificing myself for\r\nthe happiness of the heroine. She would have married me in the beginning\r\nhad I plagued her sufficiently.”\r\n\r\nI made to speak, but he interrupted me, continuing: “Ah, yes, it might\r\nhave been better. That is easy to say, not knowing. So, too, it might\r\nhave been worse--in all probability much the same. All roads lead to\r\nthe end. You know I was always a fatalist, Paul. We tried both ways. She\r\nloved me well enough, but she loved the world also. I thought she\r\nloved it better, so I kissed her on her brow, mumbled a prayer for her\r\nhappiness and made my exit to a choking sob. So ended the first act.\r\nWasn't I the hero throughout that, Paul? I thought so; slapped myself\r\nupon the back, told myself what a fine fellow I had been. Then--you know\r\nwhat followed. She was finer clay than she had fancied. Love is woman's\r\nkingdom, not the world. Even then I thought more of her than of myself.\r\nI could have borne my share of the burden had I not seen her fainting\r\nunder hers, shamed, degraded. So we dared to think for ourselves,\r\ninjuring nobody but ourselves, played the man and woman, lost the world\r\nfor love. Wasn't it brave, Paul? Were we not hero and heroine? They had\r\nprinted the playbill wrong, Paul, that was all. I was really the hero,\r\nbut the printing devil had made a slip, so instead of applauding you\r\nbooed. How could you know, any of you? It was not your fault.”\r\n\r\n“But that was not the end,” I reminded him. “If the curtain had fallen\r\nthen, I could have forgiven you.”\r\n\r\nHe grinned. “That fatal last act. Even yours don't always come right, so\r\nthe critics tell me.”\r\n\r\nThe grin faded from his face. “We may never see each other again, Paul,”\r\n he went on; “don't think too badly of me. I found I had made a second\r\nmistake--or thought I had. She was no happier with me after a time than\r\nshe had been with him. If all our longings were one, life would be easy;\r\nbut they are not. What is to be done but toss for it? And if it come\r\ndown head we wish it had been tail, and if tail we think of what we have\r\nlost through its not coming down head. Love is no more the whole of a\r\nwoman's life than it is of a man's. He did not apply for a divorce: that\r\nwas smart of him. We were shunned, ignored. To some women it might not\r\nhave mattered; but she had been used to being sought, courted, feted.\r\nShe made no complaint--did worse: made desperate effort to appear\r\ncheerful, to pretend that our humdrum life was not boring her to death.\r\nI watched her growing more listless, more depressed; grew angry with\r\nher, angrier with myself. There was no bond between us except our\r\npassion; that was real enough--'grand,' I believe, is the approved\r\nliterary adjective. It is good enough for what nature intended it, a\r\nsummer season in a cave. It makes but a poor marriage settlement in\r\nthese more complicated days. We fell to mutual recriminations, vulgar\r\nscenes. Ah, most of us look better at a little distance from one\r\nanother. The sordid, contemptible side of life became important to us. I\r\nwas never rich; by contrast with all that she had known, miserably poor.\r\nThe mere sight of the food our twelve-pound-a-year cook put upon the\r\ntable would take away her appetite. Love does not change the palate,\r\ngive you a taste for cheap claret when you have been accustomed to dry\r\nchampagne. We have bodies to think of as well as souls; we are apt to\r\nforget that in moments of excitement.\r\n\r\n“She fell ill, and it seemed to me that I had dragged her from the soil\r\nwhere she had grown only to watch her die. And then he came, precisely\r\nat the right moment. I cannot help admiring him. Most men take their\r\nrevenge clumsily, hurting themselves; he was so neat, had been so\r\npatient. I am not even ashamed of having fallen into his trap; it was\r\nadmirably baited. Maybe I had despised him for having seemed to submit\r\nmeekly to the blow. What cared he for me and my opinion? It was she was\r\nall he cared for. He knew her better than I, knew that sooner or later\r\nshe would tire, not of love but of the cottage; look back with longing\r\neyes towards all that she had lost. Fool! Cuckold! What was it to him\r\nthat the world would laugh at him, despise him? Love such as his made\r\nfools of men. Would I not give her back to him?\r\n\r\n“By God! It was fine acting; half into the night we talked, I leaving\r\nhim every now and again to creep to the top of the stairs and listen to\r\nher breathing. He asked me my advice, I being the hard-headed partner of\r\ncool judgment. What would be", "old! What was it to him\r\nthat the world would laugh at him, despise him? Love such as his made\r\nfools of men. Would I not give her back to him?\r\n\r\n“By God! It was fine acting; half into the night we talked, I leaving\r\nhim every now and again to creep to the top of the stairs and listen to\r\nher breathing. He asked me my advice, I being the hard-headed partner of\r\ncool judgment. What would be the best way of approaching her after I was\r\ngone? Where should he take her? How should they live till the nine days'\r\ntalk had died away? And I sat opposite to him--how he must have longed\r\nto laugh in my silly face--advising him! We could not quite agree as\r\nto details of a possible yachting cruise, and I remember hunting up an\r\natlas, and we pored over it, our heads close together. By God! I envy\r\nhim that night!”\r\n\r\nHe sank back on his pillows and laughed and coughed, and laughed and\r\ncoughed again, till I feared that wild, long, broken laugh would be his\r\nlast. But it ceased at length, and for awhile, exhausted, he lay silent\r\nbefore continuing.\r\n\r\n“Then came the question: how was I to go? She loved me still. He was\r\nsure of it, and, for the matter of that, so was I. So long as she\r\nthought that I loved her, she would never leave me. Only from her\r\ndespair could fresh hope arise for her. Would I not make some sacrifice\r\nfor her sake, persuade her that I had tired of her? Only by one means\r\ncould she be convinced. My going off alone would not suffice; my reason\r\nfor that she might suspect--she might follow. It would be for her sake.\r\nAgain it was the hero that I played, the dear old chuckle-headed hero,\r\nPaul, that you ought to have cheered, not hooted. I loved her as much as\r\nI ever loved her in my life, that night I left her. I took my boots\r\noff in the passage and crept up in my stockinged feet. I told him I\r\nwas merely going to change my coat and put a few things into a bag. He\r\ngripped my hand, and tears were standing in his eyes. It is odd that\r\nsuppressed laughter and expressed grief should both display the same\r\ntoken, is it not? I stole into her room. I dared not kiss her for fear\r\nof waking her; but a stray lock of her hair--you remember how long it\r\nwas--fell over the pillow, nearly reaching to the floor. I pressed my\r\nlips against it, where it trailed over the bedstead, till they bled. I\r\nhave it still upon my lips, the mingling of the cold iron and the warm,\r\nsoft silken hair. He told me, when I came down again, that I had been\r\ngone three-quarters of an hour. And we went out of the house together,\r\nhe and I. That is the last time I ever saw her.”\r\n\r\nI leant across and put my arms around him; I suppose it was un-English;\r\nthere are times when one forgets these points. “I did not know! I did\r\nnot know,” I cried.\r\n\r\nHe pressed me to him with his feeble arms. “What a cad you must have\r\nthought me, Paul,” he said. “But you might have given me credit for\r\nbetter taste. I was always rather a gourmet than a gourmand where women\r\nwere concerned.”\r\n\r\n“You have never seen him either again?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No,” he answered; “I swore to kill him when I learnt the trick he had\r\nplayed me. He commenced the divorce proceedings against her the very\r\nmorning after I had left her. Possibly, had I succeeded in finding\r\nhim within the next six months, I should have done so. A few newspaper\r\nproprietors would have been the only people really benefited. Time is\r\nthe cheapest Bravo; a little patience is all he charges. All roads lead\r\nto the end, Paul.”\r\n\r\nBut I tell my tale badly, marring effects of sunlight with the memory\r\nof shadows. At the time all promised fair. He was a handsome,\r\ndistinguished-looking man. Not every aristocrat, if without disrespect\r\nto one's betters a humble observer may say so, suggests his title; this\r\nman would have suggested his title, had he not possessed it. I suppose\r\nhe must have been about fifty at the time; but most men of thirty would\r\nhave been glad to exchange with him both figure and complexion. His\r\nbehaviour to his _fiancee_ was the essence of good taste, affectionate\r\ndevotion, carried to the exact point beyond which, having regard to the\r\ndisparity of their years, it would have appeared ridiculous. That he\r\nsincerely admired her, was fully content with her, there could be no\r\ndoubt. I am even inclined to think he was fonder of her than, divining\r\nher feelings towards himself, he cared to show. Knowledge of the world\r\nmust have told him that men of fifty find it easier to be the lovers of\r\nwomen young enough to be their daughters, than girls find it to desire\r\nthe affection of men old enough to be their fathers; and he was not the\r\nman to allow impulse to lead him into absurdity.\r\n\r\nFrom my own peculiar point of view he appeared the ideal prince consort.\r\nIt was difficult for me to imagine my queen in love with any mere man.\r\nThis was one beside whom she could live, losing in my eyes nothing of\r\nher dignity. My feelings for her he guessed at our first interview. Most\r\nmen in his position would have been amused, and many would have shown\r\nit. For what reason I cannot say, but with a tact and courtesy that left\r\nme only complimented, he drew from me, before I had met him half-a-dozen\r\ntimes, more frank confession than a month previously I should have\r\ndreamt of my yielding to anything than my own pillow. He laid his hand\r\nupon my shoulder.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if you know, my friend, how wise you are,” he said. “We all of\r\nus at your age love an image of our own carving. Ah, if only we could be\r\ncontent to worship the white, changeless statute! But we are fools. We\r\npray the gods to give her life, and under our hot kisses she becomes a\r\nwoman. I also loved when I was your age, Paul. Your countrymen, they\r\nare so practical, they know only one kind of love. It is business-like,\r\nrich--how puts it your poet? 'rich in saving common sense.' But there\r\nare many kinds, you understand that, my friend. You are wise, do not\r\nconfuse them. She was a child of the mountains. I used to walk three\r\nleagues to Mass each day to worship her. Had I been wise--had I so left\r\nit, the memory of her would have coloured all my life with glory. But\r\nI was a fool, my friend; I turned her into a woman. Ah!”--he made a\r\ngesture of disgust--“such a fat, ugly woman, Paul, I turned her into. I\r\nhad much difficulty in getting rid of her. We should never touch things\r\nin life that are beautiful; we have such clumsy hands, we spoil whatever\r\nwe touch.”\r\n\r\nHal did not return to England till the end of the year, by which time\r\nthe Count and Countess Huescar--though I had her permission still to\r\ncall her Barbara, I never availed myself of it; the “Countess” fitted my\r\nmood better--had taken up residence in the grand Paris house old Hasluck\r\nhad bought for them.\r\n\r\nIt was the high-water mark of old Hasluck's career, and, if anything,\r\nhe was a little disappointed that with the dowry he had promised her\r\nBarbara had not done even better for herself.\r\n\r\n“Foreign Counts,” he grumbled to me laughingly, one day, “well, I hope\r\nthey're worth more in Society than they are in the City. A hundred\r\nguineas is their price there, and they're not worth that. Who was that\r\nAmerican girl that married a Russian Prince only last week? A million\r\ndollars was all she gave for him, and she a wholesale boot-maker's\r\ndaughter into the bargain! Our girls are not half as smart.”\r\n\r\nBut that was before he", "umbled to me laughingly, one day, “well, I hope\r\nthey're worth more in Society than they are in the City. A hundred\r\nguineas is their price there, and they're not worth that. Who was that\r\nAmerican girl that married a Russian Prince only last week? A million\r\ndollars was all she gave for him, and she a wholesale boot-maker's\r\ndaughter into the bargain! Our girls are not half as smart.”\r\n\r\nBut that was before he had seen his future son-in-law. After, he was\r\ncontent enough, and up to the day of the wedding, childishly elated.\r\nUnder the Count's tuition he studied with reverential awe the Huescar\r\nhistory. Princes, statesmen, warriors, glittered, golden apples, from\r\nthe spreading branches of its genealogical tree. Why not again! its\r\nattenuated blue sap strengthened with the rich, red blood, brewed\r\nby toil and effort in the grim laboratories of the under world. In\r\nimagination, old Hasluck saw himself the grandfather of Chancellors, the\r\ngreat-grandfather of Kings.\r\n\r\n“I have laid the foundation, you shall raise the edifice,” so he told\r\nher one evening I was spending with them, caressing her golden hair with\r\nhis blunt, fat fingers. “I am glad you were not a boy. A boy, in all\r\nprobability, would have squandered the money, let the name sink back\r\nagain into the gutter. And even had he been the other sort, he could\r\nonly have been another business man, keeping where I had left him.\r\nYou will call your first boy Hasluck, won't you? It must always be\r\nthe first-born's name. It shall be famous in the world yet, and for\r\nsomething else than mere money.”\r\n\r\nI began to understand the influences that had gone towards the\r\nmaking--or marring--of Barbara's character. I had never guessed he had\r\ncared for anything beyond money and the making of money.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, a wedding as ostentatious as possible. Old Hasluck\r\nknew how to advertise, and spared neither expense nor labour, with the\r\nresult that it was the event of the season, at least according to the\r\nSociety papers. Mrs. Hasluck was the type of woman to have escaped\r\nobservation, even had the wedding been her own; that she was present at\r\nher daughter's, “becomingly dressed in grey veiling spotted white, with\r\nan encrustation of mousseline de soie,” I learnt the next day from the\r\n_Morning Post_. Old Hasluck himself had to be fetched every time he\r\nwas wanted. At the conclusion of the ceremony, seeking him, I found him\r\nsitting on the stairs leading to the crypt.\r\n\r\n“Is it over?” he asked. He was mopping his face on a huge handkerchief,\r\nand had a small looking-glass in his hand.\r\n\r\n“All over,” I answered, “they are waiting for you to start.”\r\n\r\n“I always perspire so when I'm excited,” he explained. “Keep me out of\r\nit as much as possible.”\r\n\r\nBut the next time I saw him, which was two or three days later, the\r\nreaction had set in. He was sitting in his great library, surrounded\r\nby books he would no more have thought of disturbing than he would of\r\nstrumming on the gorgeous grand piano inlaid with silver that ornamented\r\nhis drawing-room. A change had passed over him. His swelling rotundity,\r\nsuggestive generally of a bladder inflated to its extremest limits by\r\nexcess of self-importance, appeared to be shrinking. I put the idea\r\naside as mere fancy at the time, but it was fact; he became a mere bag\r\nof bones before he died. He was wearing an old pair of carpet slippers\r\nand smoking a short clay pipe.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, “everything went off all right.”\r\n\r\n“Everybody's gone off all right, so far,” he grunted. He was crouching\r\nover the fire, though the weather was still warm, one hand spread\r\nout towards the blaze. “Now I've got to go off, that's the only thing\r\nthey're waiting for. Then everything will be in order.”\r\n\r\n“I don't think they are wanting you to go off,” I answered, with a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n“You mean,” he answered, “I'm the goose that lays the golden eggs. Ah,\r\nbut you see, so many of the eggs break, and so many of them are bad.”\r\n\r\n“Some of them hatch all right,” I replied. The simile was becoming\r\nsomewhat confused: in conversation similes are apt to.\r\n\r\n“If I were to die this week,” he said--he paused, completing mental\r\ncalculations, “I should be worth, roughly speaking, a couple of million.\r\nThis time next year I may be owing a million.”\r\n\r\nI sat down opposite to him. “Why run risks?” I suggested. “Surely you\r\nhave enough. Why not give it up--retire?”\r\n\r\nHe laughed. “Do you think I haven't said that to myself, lad--sworn\r\nI would a dozen times a year? I can't do it; I'm a gambler. It's the\r\nearliest thing I can recollect doing, gambling with brace buttons. There\r\nare men, Paul, now dying in the workhouse--men I once knew well; I think\r\nof them sometimes, and wish I didn't--who any time during half their\r\nlife might have retired on twenty thousand a year. If I were to go to\r\nany one of them, and settle an annuity of a hundred a year upon him, the\r\nmoment my back was turned he'd sell it out and totter up to Threadneedle\r\nStreet with the proceeds. It's in our blood. I shall gamble on my\r\ndeath-bed, die with the tape in my hand.”\r\n\r\nHe kicked the fire into a blaze. A roaring flame made the room light\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“But that won't be just yet awhile,” he laughed, “and before it does,\r\nI'll be the richest man in Europe. I keep my head cool--that's the\r\ngreat secret.” Leaning over towards me, he sunk his voice to a whisper,\r\n“Drink, Paul--so many of them drink. They get worried; fifty things\r\ndancing round and round at the same time in their heads. Fifty questions\r\nto be answered in five minutes. Tick, tick, tick, taps the little devil\r\nat their elbow. This going down, that going up. Rumor of this, report\r\nof that. A fortune to be lost here, a fortune to be snatched there.\r\nEverything in a whirl! Tick, tick, tick, like nails into a coffin. God!\r\nfor five minutes' peace to think. Shut the door, turn the key. Out comes\r\nthe bottle. That's the end. All right so long as you keep away from\r\nthat. Cool, quick brain, clear judgment--that's the secret.”\r\n\r\n“But is it worth it all?” I suggested. “Surely you have enough?”\r\n\r\n“It means power, Paul.” He slapped his trousers pocket, making the\r\nhandful of gold and silver he always carried there jingle musically. “It\r\nis this that rules the world. My children shall be big pots, hobnob\r\nwith kings and princes, slap them on the back and call them by their\r\nChristian names, be kings themselves--why not? It's happened before.\r\nMy children, the children of old Noel Hasluck, son of a Whitechapel\r\nbutcher! Here's my pedigree!” Again be slapped his tuneful pocket.\r\n“It's an older one than theirs! It's coming into its own at last! It's\r\nmoney--we men of money--that are the true kings now. It's our family\r\nthat rules the world--the great money family; I mean to be its head.”\r\n\r\nThe blaze died out, leaving the room almost in darkness, and for awhile\r\nwe sat in silence.\r\n\r\n“Quiet, isn't it?” said old Hasluck, raising his head.\r\n\r\nThe settling of the falling embers was the only sound about us.\r\n\r\n“Guess we'll always be like this, now,” continued old Hasluck. “Old\r\nwoman goes to bed, you see, immediately after dinner. It used to be\r\ndifferent when _she_ was about. Somehow, the house and the lackeys and\r\nall the rest of it seemed to be a more natural sort of thing when _she_\r\nwas the centre of", " said old Hasluck, raising his head.\r\n\r\nThe settling of the falling embers was the only sound about us.\r\n\r\n“Guess we'll always be like this, now,” continued old Hasluck. “Old\r\nwoman goes to bed, you see, immediately after dinner. It used to be\r\ndifferent when _she_ was about. Somehow, the house and the lackeys and\r\nall the rest of it seemed to be a more natural sort of thing when _she_\r\nwas the centre of it. It frightens the old woman now she's gone. She\r\nlikes to get away from it. Poor old Susan! A little country inn with\r\nherself as landlady and me fussing about behind the bar; that was always\r\nher ambition, poor old girl!”\r\n\r\n“You will be visiting them,” I suggested, “and they will be coming to\r\nstop with you.”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. “They won't want me, and it isn't my game to hamper\r\nthem. I never mix out of my class. I've always had sense enough for\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nI laughed, wishing to cheer him, though I knew he was right. “Surely\r\nyour daughter belongs to your own class,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“Do you think so?” he asked, with a grin. “That's not a pretty\r\ncompliment to her. She was my child when she used to cling round my\r\nneck, while I made the sausages, calling me her dear old pig. It didn't\r\ntrouble her then that I dropped my aitches and had a greasy skin. I was\r\na Whitechapel butcher, and she was a Whitechapel brat. I could have kept\r\nher if I'd liked, but I was set upon making a lady of her, and I did it.\r\nBut I lost my child. Every time she came back from school I could see\r\nshe despised me a little more. I'm not blaming her; how could she help\r\nit? I was making a lady of her, teaching her to do it; though there were\r\nmoments when I almost hated her, felt tempted to snatch her back to me,\r\ndrag her down again to my level, make her my child again, before it was\r\ntoo late. Oh, it wasn't all unselfishness; I could have done it. She\r\nwould have remained my class then, would have married my class, and her\r\nchildren would have been my class. I didn't want that. Everything's got\r\nto be paid for. I got what I asked for; I'm not grumbling at the price.\r\nBut it ain't cheap.”\r\n\r\nHe rose and knocked the ashes from his pipe. “Ring the bell, Paul, will\r\nyou?” he said. “Let's have some light and something to drink. Don't take\r\nany notice of me. I've got the hump to-night.”\r\n\r\nIt was a minute or two before the lamp came. He put his arm upon my\r\nshoulder, leaning upon me somewhat heavily.\r\n\r\n“I used to fancy sometimes, Paul,” he said, “that you and she might have\r\nmade a match of it. I should have been disappointed for some things. But\r\nyou'd have been a bit nearer to me, you two. It never occurred to you,\r\nthat, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nHOW PAUL SET FORTH UPON A QUEST.\r\n\r\nOf old Deleglise's Sunday suppers, which, costumed from head to foot\r\nin spotless linen, he cooked himself in his great kitchen, moving with\r\nflushed, earnest face about the gleaming stove, while behind him his\r\nguests waited, ranged round the massive oaken table glittering with cut\r\nglass and silver, among which fluttered the deft hands of Madeline, his\r\nancient whitecapped Bonne, much has been already recorded, and by those\r\npossessed of greater knowledge. They who sat there talking in whispers\r\nuntil such time as old Deleglise turned towards them again, radiant\r\nwith consciousness of success, the savoury triumph steaming between his\r\nhands, when, like the sudden swell of the Moonlight Sonata, the talk\r\nwould rush once more into a roar, were men whose names were\r\nthen--and some are still--more or less household words throughout the\r\nEnglish-speaking world. Artists, musicians, actors, writers, scholars,\r\ndroles, their wit and wisdom, their sayings and their doings must be\r\ntolerably familiar to readers of memoir and biography; and if to such\r\ntheir epigrams appear less brilliant, their jests less laughable than to\r\nus who heard them spoken, that is merely because fashion in humour and\r\nin understanding changes as in all else.\r\n\r\nYou, gentle reader of my book, I shall not trouble with second-hand\r\nrecord of that which you can read elsewhere. For me it will be but\r\nto write briefly of my own brief glimpse into that charmed circle.\r\nConcerning this story more are the afternoon At Homes held by Dan and\r\nmyself upon the second floor of the old Georgian house in pleasant,\r\nquiet Queen Square. For cook and house-maid on these days it would be a\r\nbusy morning. Failing other supervision, Dan and I agreed that to secure\r\nsuccess on these important occasions each of us should criticise the\r\nwork of the other. I passed judgment on Dan's cooking, he upon my\r\nhouse-work.\r\n\r\n“Too much soda,” I would declare, sampling the cake.\r\n\r\n“You silly Juggins! It's meant to taste of soda--it's a soda cake.”\r\n\r\n“I know that. It isn't meant to taste of nothing but soda. There\r\nwants to be some cake about it also. This thing, so far as flavour\r\nis concerned, is nothing but a Seidlitz powder. You can't give people\r\nsolidified Seidlitz powders for tea!”\r\n\r\nDan would fume, but I would remain firm. The soda cake would be laid\r\naside, and something else attempted. His cookery was the one thing Dan\r\nwas obstinate about. He would never admit that anything could possibly\r\nbe wrong with it. His most ghastly failures he would devour himself\r\nlater on with pretended enjoyment. I have known him finish a sponge\r\ncake, the centre of which had to be eaten with a teaspoon, declaring it\r\nwas delicious; that eating a dry sponge cake was like eating dust; that\r\na sponge cake ought to be a trifle syrupy towards the centre. Afterwards\r\nhe would be strangely silent and drink brandy out of a wine-glass.\r\n\r\n“Call these knives clean?” It would be Dan's turn.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do.”\r\n\r\nDan would draw his finger across one, producing chiaro-oscuro.\r\n\r\n“Not if you go fingering them. Why don't you leave them alone and go on\r\nwith your own work?”\r\n\r\n“You've just wiped them, that's all.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there isn't any knife-powder.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, there is.”\r\n\r\n“Besides, it ruins knives, over-cleaning them--takes all the edge off.\r\nWe shall want them pretty sharp to cut those lemon buns of yours.”\r\n\r\n“Over-cleaning them! You don't take any pride in the place.”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord! Don't I work from morning to night?”\r\n\r\n“You lazy young devil!”\r\n\r\n“Makes one lazy, your cooking. How can a man work when he is suffering\r\nall day long from indigestion?”\r\n\r\nBut Dan would not be content until I had found the board and cleaned the\r\nknives to his complete satisfaction. Perhaps it was as well that in this\r\nway all things once a week were set in order. After lunch house-maid and\r\ncook would vanish, two carefully dressed gentlemen being left alone to\r\nreceive their guests.\r\n\r\nThese would be gathered generally from among Dan's journalistic\r\nacquaintances and my companions of the theatre. Occasionally, Minikin\r\nand Jarman would be of the number, Mrs. Peedles even once or twice\r\narriving breathless on our landing. Left to myself, I perhaps should not\r\nhave invited them, deeming them hardly fitting company to mingle with\r\nour other visitors; but Dan, having once been introduced to them,\r\noverrode such objection.\r\n\r\n“My dear Lord Chamberlain,” Dan would reply, “an ounce of originality is\r\nworth a ton of convention. Little tin ladies and gentlemen all made\r\nto pattern! One can find them everywhere. Your friends would be an\r\nacquisition to any society.”\r\n\r\n“But are they quite good form?” I hinted.\r\n\r\n“I'll tell you what we will do,” replied", " fitting company to mingle with\r\nour other visitors; but Dan, having once been introduced to them,\r\noverrode such objection.\r\n\r\n“My dear Lord Chamberlain,” Dan would reply, “an ounce of originality is\r\nworth a ton of convention. Little tin ladies and gentlemen all made\r\nto pattern! One can find them everywhere. Your friends would be an\r\nacquisition to any society.”\r\n\r\n“But are they quite good form?” I hinted.\r\n\r\n“I'll tell you what we will do,” replied Dan. “We'll forget that Mrs.\r\nPeedles keeps a lodging-house in Blackfriars. We will speak of her as\r\nour friend, 'that dear, quaint old creature, Lady P.' A title that is\r\nan oddity, whose costume always suggests the wardrobe of a provincial\r\nactress! My dear Paul, your society novelist would make a fortune out\r\nof such a character. The personages of her amusing anecdotes, instead of\r\nbeing third-rate theatrical folk, shall be Earl Blank and the Baroness\r\nde Dash. The editors of society journals shall pay me a shilling a\r\nline for them. Jarman--yes, Jarman shall be the son of a South American\r\nmillionaire. Vulgar? Nonsense! you mean racy. Minikin--he looks much\r\nmore like forty than twenty--he shall be an eminent scientist. His\r\nhead will then appear the natural size; his glass eye, the result of\r\na chemical experiment, a touch of distinction; his uncompromising\r\nrudeness, a lovable characteristic. We will make him buy a yard of\r\nred ribbon and wear it across his shirt-front, and address him as Herr\r\nProfessor. It will explain slight errors of English grammar and all\r\npeculiarities of accent. They shall be our lions. You leave it to me. We\r\nwill invite commonplace, middle-class folk to meet them.”\r\n\r\nAnd this, to my terror and alarm, Dan persisted in doing. Jarman entered\r\ninto the spirit of the joke with gusto. So far as he was concerned, our\r\nguests, from the beginning to the end, were one and all, I am confident,\r\ndeceived. The more he swaggered, the more he boasted, the more he talked\r\nabout himself--and it was a failing he was prone to--the greater was\r\nhis success. At the persistent endeavours of Dan's journalistic\r\nacquaintances to excite his cupidity by visions of new journals, to be\r\nstarted with a mere couple of thousand pounds and by the inherent\r\nmerit of their ideas to command at once a circulation of hundreds of\r\nthousands, I could afford to laugh. But watching the tremendous efforts\r\nof my actress friends to fascinate him--luring him into corners, gazing\r\nat him with languishing eyes, trotting out all their little tricks\r\nfor his exclusive benefit, quarrelling about him among themselves--my\r\nconscience would prick me, lest our jest should end in a contretemps.\r\nFortunately, Jarman himself, was a gentleman of uncommon sense, or my\r\nfears might have been realised. I should have been sorry myself to have\r\nbeen asked to remain stone under the blandishments of girls young and\r\nold, of women handsome and once, no doubt, good looking, showered upon\r\nhim during that winter. But Jarman, as I think I have explained, was no\r\nslave to female charms. He enjoyed his good time while it lasted, and\r\neventually married the eldest daughter of a small blacking factory. She\r\nwas a plain girl, but pleasant, and later brought to Jarman possession\r\nof the factory. When I meet him--he is now stout and rubicund--he gives\r\nme the idea of a man who has attained to his ideals.\r\n\r\nWith Minikin we had more trouble. People turned up possessed of\r\nscientific smattering. We had to explain that the Professor never talked\r\nshop. Others were owners of unexpected knowledge of German, which they\r\ninsisted upon airing. We had to explain that the Herr Professor was\r\nin London to learn English, and had taken a vow during his residence\r\nneither to speak nor listen to his native tongue. It was remarked that\r\nhis acquaintance with colloquial English slang, for a foreigner, was\r\nquite unusual. Occasionally he was too rude, even for a scientist,\r\ninforming ladies, clamouring to know how he liked English women, that he\r\ndidn't like them silly; telling one gentleman, a friend of Dan, a rather\r\nimportant man who once asked him, referring to his yard of ribbon, what\r\nhe got it for, that he got it for fourpence. We had to explain him as\r\na gentleman who had been soured by a love disappointment. The ladies\r\nforgave him; the gentlemen said it was a damned lucky thing for the\r\ngirl. Altogether, Minikin took a good deal of explaining.\r\n\r\nLady Peedles, our guests decided among themselves, must be the widow of\r\nsome one in the City who had been knighted in a crowd. They made fun of\r\nher behind her back, but to her face were most effusive. “My dear Lady\r\nPeedles” was the phrase most often heard in our rooms whenever she was\r\npresent. At the theatre “my friend Lady Peedles” became a person much\r\nspoken of--generally in loud tones. My own social position I found\r\ndecidedly improved by reason of her ladyship's evident liking for\r\nmyself. It went abroad that I was her presumptive heir. I was courted as\r\na gentleman of expectations.\r\n\r\nThe fishy-eyed young man became one of our regular guests. Dan won his\r\nheart by never laughing at him.\r\n\r\n“I like talking to you,” said the fishy-eyed young man one afternoon to\r\nDan. “You don't go into fits of laughter when I remark that it has been\r\na fine day; most people do. Of course, on the stage I don't mind. I\r\nknow I am a funny little devil. I get my living by being a funny little\r\ndevil. There is a photograph of me hanging in the theatre lobby. I saw\r\na workman stop and look at it the other day as he passed; I was just\r\nbehind him. He burst into a roar of laughter. 'Little--! He makes me\r\nlaugh to look at him!' he cluttered to himself. Well, that's all right;\r\nI want the man in the gallery to think me funny, but it annoys me when\r\npeople laugh at me off the stage. If I am out to dinner anywhere and ask\r\nsomebody to pass the mustard, I never get it; instead, they burst out\r\nlaughing. I don't want people to laugh at me when I am having my dinner.\r\nI want my dinner. It makes me very angry sometimes.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” agreed Dan, sympathetically. “The world never grasps the fact\r\nthat man is a collection, not a single exhibit. I remember being at a\r\nhouse once where the chief guest happened to be a great Hebrew scholar.\r\nOne tea time, a Miss Henman, passing the butter to some one in a hurry,\r\nlet it slip out of her hand. 'Why is Miss Henman like a caterpillar?'\r\nasked our learned guest in a sepulchral voice. Nobody appeared to know.\r\n'Because she makes the butter fly.' It never occurred to any one of us\r\nthat the Doctor could possibly joke. There was dead silence for about\r\na minute. Then our hostess, looking grave, remarked: 'Oh, do you really\r\nthink so?'”\r\n\r\n“If I were to enter a room full of people,” said the fishy-eyed young\r\nman, “and tell them that my mother had been run over by an omnibus, they\r\nwould think it the funniest story they had heard in years.”\r\n\r\nHe was playing a principal part now in the opera, and it was he\r\nundoubtedly who was drawing the house. But he was not happy.\r\n\r\n“I am not a comic actor, really,” he explained. “I could play Romeo, so\r\nfar as feeling is concerned, and play it damned well. There is a fine\r\nvein of poetry in me. But of course it's no good to me with this face of\r\nmine.”\r\n\r\n“But are you not sinning your mercies, you fellows?” Dan replied. “There\r\nis young Kelver here. At school it was always his trouble that he could\r\ngive us a good time and make us laugh, which nobody else in the whole\r\nschool could do. His ambition was to kick a", " concerned, and play it damned well. There is a fine\r\nvein of poetry in me. But of course it's no good to me with this face of\r\nmine.”\r\n\r\n“But are you not sinning your mercies, you fellows?” Dan replied. “There\r\nis young Kelver here. At school it was always his trouble that he could\r\ngive us a good time and make us laugh, which nobody else in the whole\r\nschool could do. His ambition was to kick a ball as well as a hundred\r\nother fellows could kick it. He could tell us a good story now if he\r\nwould only write what the Almighty intended him to write, instead of\r\ngloomy rigmaroles about suffering Princesses in Welsh caves. I don't\r\nsay it's bad, but a hundred others could write the same sort of thing\r\nbetter.”\r\n\r\n“Can't you understand,” answered the little man; “the poorest tragedian\r\nthat ever lived never wished himself the best of low comedians. The\r\ncourt fool had an excellent salary, no doubt; and, likely enough, had\r\ngot two-thirds of all the brain there was in the palace. But not a\r\nwooden-headed man-at-arms but looked down upon him. Every gallery boy\r\nwho pays a shilling to laugh at me regards himself as my intellectual\r\nsuperior; while to a fourth-rate spouter of blank verse he looks up in\r\nadmiration.”\r\n\r\n“Does it so very much matter,” suggested Dan, “how the wooden-headed\r\nman-at-arms or the shilling gallery boy happens to regard you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it does,” retorted Goggles, “because we happen to agree with them.\r\nIf I could earn five pounds a week as juvenile lead, I would never play\r\na comic part again.”\r\n\r\n“There I cannot follow you,” returned Dan. “I can understand the artist\r\nwho would rather be the man of action, the poet who would rather be the\r\nstatesman or the warrior; though personally my sympathies are precisely\r\nthe other way--with Wolfe who thought it a more glorious work, the\r\nwriting of a great poem, than the burning of so many cities and the\r\nkilling of so many men. We all serve the community. It is difficult,\r\nlooking at the matter from the inside, to say who serves it best. Some\r\nfeed it, some clothe it. The churchman and the policeman between them\r\nlook after its morals, keep it in order. The doctor mends it when it\r\ninjures itself; the lawyer helps it to quarrel, the soldier teaches it\r\nto fight. We Bohemians amuse it, instruct it. We can argue that we are\r\nthe most important. The others cater for its body, we for its mind. But\r\ntheir work is more showy than ours and attracts more attention; and to\r\nattract attention is the aim and object of most of us. But for Bohemians\r\nto worry among themselves which is the greatest, is utterly without\r\nreason. The story-teller, the musician, the artist, the clown, we are\r\nmembers of a sharing troupe; one, with the ambition of the fat boy in\r\nPickwick, makes the people's flesh creep; another makes them hold their\r\nsides with laughter. The tragedian, soliloquising on his crimes, shows\r\nus how wicked we are; you, looking at a pair of lovers from under a\r\nscratch wig, show us how ridiculous we are. Both lessons are necessary:\r\nwho shall say which is the superior teacher?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I am not a philosopher,” replied the little man, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” returned Dan, with another, “and I am not a comic actor on my\r\nway to a salary of a hundred a week. We all of us want the other boy's\r\ncake.”\r\n\r\nThe O'Kelly was another frequent visitor of ours. The attic in Belsize\r\nSquare had been closed. In vain had the O'Kelly wafted incense, burned\r\npastilles and sprinkled eau-de-Cologne. In vain had he talked of rats,\r\nhinted at drains.\r\n\r\n“A wonderful woman,” groaned the O'Kelly in tones of sorrowful\r\nadmiration. “There's no deceiving her.”\r\n\r\n“But why submit?” was our natural argument. “Why not say you are going\r\nto smoke, and do it?”\r\n\r\n“It's her theory, me boy,” explained the O'Kelly, “that the home should\r\nbe kept pure--a sort of a temple, ye know. She's convinced that in time\r\nit is bound to exercise an influence upon me. It's a beautiful idea,\r\nwhen ye come to think of it.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the rooms of half-a-dozen sinful men the O'Kelly kept his\r\nown particular pipe, together with his own particular smoking mixture;\r\nand one such pipe and one such tobacco jar stood always on our\r\nmantelpiece.\r\n\r\nIn the spring the forces of temptation raged round that feeble but most\r\nexcellently intentioned citadel, the O'Kelly's conscience. The Signora\r\nhad returned to England, was performing then at Ashley's Theatre. The\r\nO'Kelly would remain under long spells of silence, puffing vigorously\r\nat his pipe. Or would fortify himself with paeans in praise of Mrs.\r\nO'Kelly.\r\n\r\n“If anything could ever make a model man of me”--he spoke in the tones\r\nof one whose doubts are stronger than his hopes--“it would be the\r\nexample of that woman.”\r\n\r\nIt was one Saturday afternoon. I had just returned from the matinee.\r\n\r\n“I don't believe,” continued the O'Kelly, “I don't really believe she\r\nhas ever done one single thing she oughtn't to, or left undone one\r\nsingle thing she ought, in the whole course of her life.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe she has, and you don't know of it,” I suggested, perceiving the\r\nidea might comfort him.\r\n\r\n“I wish I could think so,” returned the O'Kelly. “I don't mean anything\r\nreally wrong,” he corrected himself quickly, “but something just a\r\nlittle wrong. I feel--I really feel I should like her better if she\r\nhad.”\r\n\r\n“Not that I mean I don't like her as it is, ye understand,” corrected\r\nhimself the O'Kelly a second time. “I respect that woman--I cannot tell\r\nye, me boy, how much I respect her. Ye don't know her. There was one\r\nmorning, about a month ago. That woman--she's down at six every morning,\r\nsummer and winter; we have prayers at half-past. I was a trifle late\r\nmeself: it was never me strong point, as ye know, early rising. Seven\r\no'clock struck; she didn't appear, and I thought she had overslept\r\nherself. I won't say I didn't feel pleased for the moment; it was an\r\nunworthy sentiment, but I almost wished she had. I ran up to her room.\r\nThe door was open, the bedclothes folded down as she always leaves them.\r\nShe came in five minutes later. She had got up at four that morning\r\nto welcome a troupe of native missionaries from East Africa on their\r\narrival at Waterloo Station. She's a saint, that woman; I am not worthy\r\nof her.”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn't dwell too much on that phase of the subject,” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“I can't help it, me boy,” replied the O'Kelly. “I feel I am not.”\r\n\r\n“I don't for a moment say you are,” I returned; “but I shouldn't harp\r\nupon the idea. I don't think it good for you.”\r\n\r\n“I never will be,” he persisted gloomily, “never!”\r\n\r\nEvidently he was started on a dangerous train of reflection. With the\r\nidea of luring him away from it, I led the conversation to the subject\r\nof champagne.\r\n\r\n“Most people like it dry,” admitted the O'Kelly. “Meself, I have always\r\npreferred it with just a suggestion of fruitiness.”\r\n\r\n“There was a champagne,” I said, “you used to be rather fond of when\r\nwe--years ago.”\r\n\r\n“I think I know the one ye mean,” said the O'Kelly. “It wasn't at all\r\nbad, considering the price.”\r\n\r\n“You don't happen to remember where you got it?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“It was in Bridge Street,” remembered the O'Kelly, “not so very far from\r\nthe Circus.”\r\n\r\n“It is a pleasant evening,” I remarked; “", "“There was a champagne,” I said, “you used to be rather fond of when\r\nwe--years ago.”\r\n\r\n“I think I know the one ye mean,” said the O'Kelly. “It wasn't at all\r\nbad, considering the price.”\r\n\r\n“You don't happen to remember where you got it?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“It was in Bridge Street,” remembered the O'Kelly, “not so very far from\r\nthe Circus.”\r\n\r\n“It is a pleasant evening,” I remarked; “let us take a walk.”\r\n\r\nWe found the place, half wine-shop, half office.\r\n\r\n“Just the same,” commented the O'Kelly as we pushed open the door and\r\nentered. “Not altered a bit.”\r\n\r\nAs in all probability barely twelve months had elapsed since his last\r\nvisit, the fact in itself was not surprising. Clearly the O'Kelly had\r\nbeen calculating time rather by sensation. I ordered a bottle; and we\r\nsat down. Myself, being prejudiced against the brand, I called for a\r\nglass of claret. The O'Kelly finished the bottle. I was glad to notice\r\nmy ruse had been successful. The virtue of that wine had not departed\r\nfrom it. With every glass the O'Kelly became morally more elevated.\r\nHe left the place, determined that he would be worthy of Mrs. O'Kelly.\r\nWalking down the Embankment, he asserted his determination of buying an\r\nalarm-clock that very evening. At the corner of Westminster Bridge he\r\nbecame suddenly absorbed in his own thoughts. Looking to discover the\r\ncause of his silence, I saw that his eyes were resting on a poster\r\nrepresenting a charming lady standing on one leg upon a wire; below\r\nher--at some distance--appeared the peaks of mountains; the artist\r\nhad even caught the likeness. I cursed the luck that had directed our\r\nfootsteps, but the next moment, lacking experience, was inclined to be\r\nreassured.\r\n\r\n“Me dear Paul,” said the O'Kelly--he laid a fatherly hand upon my\r\nshoulder--“there are fair-faced, laughing women--sweet creatures,\r\nthat ye want to put yer arm around and dance with.” He shook his head\r\ndisapprovingly. “There are the sainted women, who lead us up, Paul--up,\r\nalways up.”\r\n\r\nA look, such as the young man with the banner might have borne with him\r\nto the fields of snow and ice, suffused the O'Kelly's handsome face.\r\nWithout another word he crossed the road and entered an American store,\r\nwhere for six-and-elevenpence he purchased an alarm-clock the man\r\nassured us would awake an Egyptian mummy. With this in his hand he waved\r\nme a good-bye, and jumped upon a Hampstead 'bus, and alone I strolled on\r\nto the theatre.\r\n\r\nHal returned a little after Christmas and started himself in chambers\r\nin the City. It was the nearest he dared venture, so he said, to\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\n“I'd be no good in the West End,” he explained. “For a season I might\r\nattract as an eccentricity, but your swells would never stand me for\r\nlonger--no more would any respectable folk, anywhere: we don't get on\r\ntogether. I commenced at Richmond. It was a fashionable suburb then,\r\nand I thought I was going to do wonders. I had everything in my favour,\r\nexcept myself. I do know my work, nobody can deny that of me. My\r\nfather spent every penny he had, poor gentleman, in buying me an\r\nold-established practice: fine house, carriage and pair, white-haired\r\nbutler--everything correct, except myself. It was of no use. I can hold\r\nmyself in for a month or two; then I break out, the old original savage\r\nthat I am under my frock coat. I feel I must run amuck, stabbing,\r\nhacking at the prim, smiling Lies mincing round about me. I can fool a\r\nsilly woman for half-a-dozen visits; bow and rub my hands, purr round\r\nher sympathetically. All the while I am longing to tell her the truth:\r\n\r\n“'Go home. Wash your face; don't block up the pores of your skin with\r\npaint. Let out your corsets. You are thirty-three round the abdomen if\r\nyou are an inch: how can you expect your digestion to do its work when\r\nyou're squeezing it into twenty-one? Give up gadding about half your day\r\nand most of your night; you are old enough to have done with that sort\r\nof thing. Let the children come, and suckle them yourself. You'll be all\r\nthe better for them. Don't loll in bed all the morning. Get up like a\r\ndecent animal and do something for your living. Use your brain, what\r\nthere is of it, and your body. At that price you can have health\r\nto-morrow, and at no other. I can do nothing for you.'\r\n\r\n“And sooner or later I blurt it out.” He laughed his great roar. “Lord!\r\nyou should see the real face coming out of the simpering mask.\r\n\r\n“Pompous old fools, strutting into me like turkey-cocks! By Jove, it was\r\nworth it! They would dribble out, looking half their proper size after I\r\nhad done telling them what was the matter with them.\r\n\r\n“'Do you want to know what you are really suffering from?' I would shout\r\nat them, when I could contain myself no longer. 'Gluttony, my dear sir;\r\ngluttony and drunkenness, and over-indulgence in other vices that shall\r\nbe nameless. Live like a man; get a little self-respect from somewhere;\r\ngive up being an ape. Treat your body properly and it will treat you\r\nproperly. That's the only prescription that will do you any good.'”\r\n\r\nHe laughed again. “'Tell the truth, you shame the Devil.' But the Devil\r\nreplies by starving you. It's a fairly effective retort. I am not the\r\nstuff successful family physicians are made of. In the City I may manage\r\nto rub along. One doesn't see so much of one's patients; they come and\r\ngo. Clerks and warehousemen my practice will be among chiefly. The poor\r\nman does not so much mind being told the truth about himself; it is a\r\nblessing to which he is accustomed.”\r\n\r\nWe spoke but once of Barbara. A photograph of her in her bride's\r\ndress stood upon my desk. Occasionally, first fitting the room for\r\nthe ceremony, sweeping away all impurity even from under the mats, and\r\ndressing myself with care, I would centre it amid flowers, and kneeling,\r\nkiss her hand where it rested on the back of the top-heavy looking chair\r\nwithout which no photographic studio is complete.\r\n\r\nOne day he took it up, and looked at it long and hard.\r\n\r\n“The forehead denotes intellectuality; the eyes tenderness and courage.\r\nThe lower part of the face, on the other hand, suggests a good deal\r\nof animalism: the finely cut nostrils show egotism--another word for\r\nselfishness; the nose itself, vanity; the lips, sensuousness and love\r\nof luxury. I wonder what sort of woman she really is.” He laid the\r\nphotograph back upon the desk.\r\n\r\n“I did not know you were so firm a believer in Lavater,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Only when he agrees with what I know,” he answered. “Have I not\r\ndescribed her rightly?”\r\n\r\n“I do not care to discuss her in that vein,” I replied, feeling the\r\nblood mounting to my cheeks.\r\n\r\n“Too sacred a subject?” he laughed. “It is the one ingredient of manhood\r\nI lack, ideality--an unfortunate deficiency for me. I must probe,\r\nanalyse, dissect, see the thing as it really is, know it for what it\r\nis.”\r\n\r\n“Well, she is the Countess Huescar now,” I said. “For God's sake, leave\r\nher alone.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to me with the snarl of a beast. “How do you know she is the\r\nCountess Huescar? Is it a special breed of woman made on purpose? How do\r\nyou know she isn't my wife--brain and heart, flesh and blood, mine? If\r\nshe was, do you think I should give her up because some fool has stuck\r\nhis label on her?”\r\n\r\nI felt the anger burning in my eyes. “Yours, his! She is no man's\r\nproperty.", "arl of a beast. “How do you know she is the\r\nCountess Huescar? Is it a special breed of woman made on purpose? How do\r\nyou know she isn't my wife--brain and heart, flesh and blood, mine? If\r\nshe was, do you think I should give her up because some fool has stuck\r\nhis label on her?”\r\n\r\nI felt the anger burning in my eyes. “Yours, his! She is no man's\r\nproperty. She is herself,” I cried.\r\n\r\nThe wrinkles round his nose and mouth smoothed themselves out. “You need\r\nnot be afraid,” he sneered. “As you say, she is the Countess Huescar.\r\nCan you imagine her as Mrs. Doctor Washburn? I can't.” He took her\r\nphotograph in his hand again. “The lower part of the face is the true\r\nindex to the character. It shows the animal, and it is the animal that\r\nrules. The soul, the intellect, it comes and goes; the animal remains\r\nalways. Sensuousness, love of luxury, vanity, those are the strings to\r\nwhich she dances. To be a Countess is of more importance to her than to\r\nbe a woman. She is his, not mine. Let him keep her.”\r\n\r\n“You do not know her,” I answered; “you never have. You listen to what\r\nshe says. She does not know herself.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me queerly. “What do you think her to be?” he asked me. “A\r\ntrue woman, not the shallow thing she seems?”\r\n\r\n“A true woman,” I persisted stoutly, “that you have not eyes enough to\r\nsee.”\r\n\r\n“You little fool!” he muttered, with the same queer look--“you little\r\nfool. But let us hope you are wrong, Paul. Let us hope, for her sake,\r\nyou are wrong.”\r\n\r\nIt was at one of Deleglise's Sunday suppers that I first met Urban Vane.\r\nThe position, nor even the character, I fear it must be confessed, of\r\nhis guests was never enquired into by old Deleglise. A simple-minded,\r\nkindly old fellow himself, it was his fate to be occasionally surprised\r\nand grieved at the discovery that even the most entertaining of supper\r\ncompanions could fall short of the highest standard of conventional\r\nmorality.\r\n\r\n“Dear, dear me!” he would complain, pacing up and down his studio\r\nwith puzzled visage. “The last man in the world of whom I should have\r\nexpected to hear it. So original in all his ideas. Are you quite sure?”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid there can be no doubt about it.”\r\n\r\n“I can't believe it! I really can't believe it! One of the most amusing\r\nmen I ever met!”\r\n\r\nI remember a well-known artist one evening telling us with much sense of\r\nhumour how he had just completed the sale of an old Spanish cabinet to\r\ntwo distinct and separate purchasers.\r\n\r\n“I sold it first,” recounted the little gentleman with glee, “to old\r\nJong, the dealer. He has been worrying me about it for the last three\r\nmonths, and on Saturday afternoon, hearing that I was clearing out\r\nand going abroad, he came round again. 'Well, I am not sure I am in a\r\nposition to sell it,' I told him. 'Who'll know?' he asked. 'They are not\r\nin, are they?' 'Not yet,' I answered, 'but I expect they will be some\r\ntime on Monday.' 'Tell your man to open the door to me at eight o'clock\r\non Monday morning,' he replied, 'we'll have it away without any fuss.\r\nThere needn't be any receipt. I'm lending you a hundred pounds, in\r\ncash.' I worked him up to a hundred and twenty, and he paid me. Upon my\r\nword, I should never have thought of it, if he hadn't put the idea into\r\nmy head. But turning round at the door: 'You won't go and sell it to\r\nsome one else,' he suggested, 'between now and Monday?' It serves him\r\nright for his damned impertinence. 'Send and take it away to-day if you\r\nare at all nervous,' I told him. He looked at the thing, it is about\r\ntwelve feet high altogether. 'I would if I could get a cart,' he\r\nmuttered. Then an idea struck him. 'Does the top come off?' 'See for\r\nyourself,' I answered; 'it's your cabinet, not mine.' I was feeling\r\nrather annoyed with him. He examined it. 'That's all right,' he said;\r\n'merely a couple of screws. I'll take the top with me now on my cab.'\r\nHe got a man in, and they took the upper cupboard away, leaving me the\r\nbottom. Two hours later old Sir George called to see me about his wife's\r\nportrait. The first thing he set eyes on was the remains of the cabinet:\r\nhe had always admired it. 'Hallo,' he asked, 'are you breaking up the\r\nstudio literally? What have you done with the other half?' 'I've sent\r\nit round to Jong's--' He didn't give me time to finish. 'Save Jong's\r\ncommission and sell it to me direct,' he said. 'We won't argue about the\r\nprice and I'll pay you in cash.'\r\n\r\n“Well, if Providence comes forward and insists on taking charge of\r\na man, it is hardly good manners to flout her. Besides, his wife's\r\nportrait is worth twice as much as he is paying for it. He handed me\r\nover the money in notes. 'Things not going quite smoothly with you just\r\nat the moment?' he asked me. 'Oh, about the same as usual,' I told him.\r\n'You won't be offended at my taking it away with me this evening?' he\r\nasked. 'Not in the least,' I answered; 'you'll get it on the top of a\r\nfour-wheeled cab.' We called in a couple of men, and I helped them down\r\nwith it, and confoundedly heavy it was. 'I shall send round to Jong's\r\nfor the other half on Monday morning,' he said, speaking with his head\r\nthrough the cab window, 'and explain it to him.' 'Do,' I answered;\r\n'he'll understand.'\r\n\r\n“I'm sorry I'm going away so early in the morning,” concluded the little\r\ngentleman. “I'd give back Jong ten per cent. of his money to see his\r\nface when he enters the studio.”\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed; but after the little gentleman was gone, the subject\r\ncropped up again.\r\n\r\n“If I wake sufficiently early,” remarked one, “I shall find an excuse\r\nto look in myself at eight o'clock. Jong's face will certainly be worth\r\nseeing.”\r\n\r\n“Rather rough both on him and Sir George,” observed another.\r\n\r\n“Oh, he hasn't really done anything of the kind,” chimed in old\r\nDeleglise in his rich, sweet voice. “He made that all up. It's just his\r\nfun; he's full of humour.”\r\n\r\n“I am inclined to think that would be his idea of a joke,” asserted the\r\nfirst speaker.\r\n\r\nOld Deleglise would not hear of it; but a week or two later I noticed an\r\naddition to old Deleglise's studio furniture in the shape of a handsome\r\nold carved cabinet twelve feet high.\r\n\r\n“He really had done it,” explained old Deleglise, speaking in a whisper,\r\nthough only he and I were present. “Of course, it was only his fun; but\r\nit might have been misunderstood. I thought it better to put the thing\r\nstraight. I shall get the money back from him when he returns. A most\r\namusing little man!”\r\n\r\nOld Deleglise possessed a house in Gower Street which fell vacant. One\r\nof his guests, a writer of poetical drama, was a man who three months\r\nafter he had earned a thousand pounds never had a penny with which\r\nto bless himself. They are dying out, these careless, good-natured,\r\nconscienceless Bohemians; but quarter of a century ago they still\r\nlingered in Alsatian London. Turned out of his lodgings by a Philistine\r\nlandlord, his sole possession in the wide world, two acts of a drama,\r\nfor which he had already been paid, the problem of his future, though\r\nit troubled him but little, became acute to his friends. Old De", "to bless himself. They are dying out, these careless, good-natured,\r\nconscienceless Bohemians; but quarter of a century ago they still\r\nlingered in Alsatian London. Turned out of his lodgings by a Philistine\r\nlandlord, his sole possession in the wide world, two acts of a drama,\r\nfor which he had already been paid, the problem of his future, though\r\nit troubled him but little, became acute to his friends. Old Deleglise,\r\ntreating the matter as a joke, pretending not to know who was the\r\nlandlord, suggested he should apply to the agents for position as\r\ncaretaker. Some furniture was found for him, and the empty house in\r\nGower Street became his shelter. The immediate present thus provided\r\nfor, kindly old Deleglise worried himself a good deal concerning what\r\nwould become of his friend when the house was let. There appeared to be\r\nno need for worry. Weeks, months went by. Applications were received\r\nby the agents in fair number, view cards signed by the dozen; but\r\nprospective tenants were never seen again. One Sunday evening our poet,\r\nwarmed by old Deleglise's Burgundy, forgetful whose recommendation\r\nhad secured him the lowly but timely appointment, himself revealed the\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\n“Most convenient place I've got,” so he told old Deleglise. “Whole house\r\nto myself. I wander about; it just suits me.”\r\n\r\n“I'm glad to hear that,” murmured old Deleglise.\r\n\r\n“Come and see me, and I'll cook you a chop,” continued the other. “I've\r\nhad the kitchen range brought up into the back drawing-room; saves going\r\nup and down stairs.”\r\n\r\n“The devil you have!” growled old Deleglise. “What do you think the\r\nowner of the house will say?”\r\n\r\n“Haven't the least idea who the poor old duffer is myself. They've put\r\nme in as caretaker--an excellent arrangement: avoids all argument about\r\nrent.”\r\n\r\n“Afraid it will soon come to an end, that excellent arrangement;”\r\n remarked old Deleglise, drily.\r\n\r\n“Why? Why should it?”\r\n\r\n“A house in Gower Street oughtn't to remain vacant long.”\r\n\r\n“This one will.”\r\n\r\n“You might tell me,” asked old Deleglise, with a grim smile; “how do you\r\nmanage it? What happens when people come to look over the house--don't\r\nyou let them in?”\r\n\r\n“I tried that at first,” explained the poet, “but they would go on\r\nknocking, and boys and policemen passing would stop and help them. It\r\ngot to be a nuisance; so now I have them in, and get the thing over.\r\nI show them the room where the murder was committed. If it's a\r\nnervous-looking party, I let them off with a brief summary. If that\r\ndoesn't do, I go into details and show them the blood-spots on the\r\nfloor. It's an interesting story of the gruesome order. Come round one\r\nmorning and I'll tell it to you. I'm rather proud of it. With the blinds\r\ndown and a clock in the next room that ticks loudly, it goes well.”\r\n\r\nYet this was a man who, were the merest acquaintance to call upon him\r\nand ask for his assistance, would at once take him by the arm and lead\r\nhim upstairs. All notes and cheques that came into his hands he changed\r\nat once into gold. Into some attic half filled with lumber he would\r\nfling it by the handful; then, locking the door, leave it there. On\r\ntheir hands and knees he and his friends, when they wanted any, would\r\ngrovel for it, poking into corners, hunting under boxes, groping among\r\nbroken furniture, feeling between cracks and crevices. Nothing gave him\r\ngreater delight than an expedition of this nature to what he termed his\r\ngold-field; it had for him, as he would explain, all the excitements\r\nof mining without the inconvenience and the distance. He never knew how\r\nmuch was there. For a certain period a pocketful could be picked up in\r\nfive minutes. Then he would entertain a dozen men at one of the best\r\nrestaurants in London, tip cabmen and waiters with half-sovereigns,\r\nshower half-crowns as he walked through the streets, lend or give to\r\nanybody for the asking. Later, half-an-hour's dusty search would be\r\nrewarded with a single coin. It made no difference to him; he would dine\r\nin Soho for eighteenpence, smoke shag, and run into debt.\r\n\r\nThe red-haired man, to whom Deleglise had introduced me on the day of\r\nmy first meeting with the Lady of the train, was another of his most\r\nconstant visitors. It flattered my vanity that the red-haired man, whose\r\nname was famous throughout Europe and America, should condescend to\r\nconfide to me--as he did and at some length--the deepest secrets of his\r\nbosom. Awed--at all events at first--I would sit and listen while by\r\nthe hour he would talk to me in corners, telling me of the women he had\r\nloved. They formed a somewhat large collection. Julias, Marias, Janets,\r\neven Janes--he had madly worshipped, deliriously adored so many it grew\r\nbewildering. With a far-away look in his eyes, pain trembling through\r\neach note of his musical, soft voice, he would with bitter jest, with\r\npassionate outburst, recount how he had sobbed beneath the stars for\r\nlove of Isabel, bitten his own flesh in frenzied yearning for Lenore. He\r\nappeared from his own account--if in connection with a theme so poetical\r\nI may be allowed a commonplace expression--to have had no luck with\r\nany of them. Of the remainder, an appreciable percentage had been mere\r\npassing visions, seen at a distance in the dawn, at twilight--generally\r\nspeaking, when the light must have been uncertain. Never again, though\r\nhe had wandered in the neighbourhood for months, had he succeeded in\r\nmeeting them. It would occur to me that enquiries among the neighbours,\r\napplications to the local police, might possibly have been efficacious;\r\nbut to have broken in upon his exalted mood with such suggestions would\r\nhave demanded more nerve than at the time I possessed. In consequence,\r\nmy thoughts I kept to myself.\r\n\r\n“My God, boy!” he would conclude, “may you never love as I loved that\r\nwoman Miriam”--or Henrietta, or Irene, as the case might be.\r\n\r\nFor my sympathetic attitude towards the red-haired man I received one\r\nevening commendation from old Deleglise.\r\n\r\n“Good boy,” said old Deleglise, laying his hand on my shoulder. We were\r\nstanding in the passage. We had just shaken hands with the red-haired\r\nman, who, as usual, had been the last to leave. “None of the others will\r\nlisten to him. He used to stop and confide it all to me after everybody\r\nelse had gone. Sometimes I have dropped asleep, to wake an hour later\r\nand find him still talking. He gets it over early now. Good boy!”\r\n\r\nSoon I learnt it was characteristic of the artist to be willing--nay,\r\nanxious, to confide his private affairs to any one and every one who\r\nwould only listen. Another characteristic appeared to be determination\r\nnot to listen to anybody else's. As attentive recipient of other\r\npeople's troubles and emotions I was subjected to practically no\r\ncompetition whatever. One gentleman, a leading actor of that day, I\r\nremember, immediately took me aside on my being introduced to him, and\r\nconsulted me as to his best course of procedure under the extremely\r\npainful conditions that had lately arisen between himself and his wife.\r\nWe discussed the unfortunate position at some length, and I did my best\r\nto counsel fairly and impartially.\r\n\r\n“I wish you would lunch with me at White's to-morrow,” he said. “We can\r\ntalk it over quietly. Say half-past one. By the bye, I didn't catch your\r\nname.”\r\n\r\nI spelt it to him: he wrote the appointment down on his shirt-cuff. I\r\nwent to White's the next day and waited an hour, but he did not turn\r\nup. I met him three weeks later at a garden-party with his wife. But he\r\nappeared", " would lunch with me at White's to-morrow,” he said. “We can\r\ntalk it over quietly. Say half-past one. By the bye, I didn't catch your\r\nname.”\r\n\r\nI spelt it to him: he wrote the appointment down on his shirt-cuff. I\r\nwent to White's the next day and waited an hour, but he did not turn\r\nup. I met him three weeks later at a garden-party with his wife. But he\r\nappeared to have forgotten me.\r\n\r\nObserving old Deleglise's guests, comparing them with their names, it\r\nsurprised me the disconnection between the worker and the work. Writers\r\nof noble sentiment, of elevated ideality, I found contained in men of\r\ncommonplace appearance, of gross appetites, of conventional ideas.\r\nIt seemed doubtful whether they fully comprehended their own work;\r\ncertainly it had no effect upon their own lives. On the other hand, an\r\ninnocent, boyish young man, who lived the most correct of lives with\r\na girlish-looking wife in an ivy-covered cottage near Barnes Common,\r\nI discovered to be the writer of decadent stories at which the Empress\r\nTheodora might have blushed. The men whose names were widest known were\r\nnot the men who shone the brightest in Deleglise's kitchen; more\r\noften they appeared the dull dogs, listening enviously, or failing\r\npathetically when they tried to compete with others who to the public\r\nwere comparatively unknown. After a time I ceased to confound the artist\r\nwith the man, thought no more of judging the one by the other than of\r\nevolving a tenant from the house to which circumstances or carelessness\r\nmight have directed him. Clearly they were two creations originally\r\nindependent of each other, settling down into a working partnership\r\nfor purposes merely of mutual accommodation; the spirit evidently\r\nindifferent as to the particular body into which he crept, anxious only\r\nfor a place to work in, easily contented.\r\n\r\nVaried were these guests that gathered round old Deleglise's oak.\r\nCabinet Ministers reported to be in Homburg; Russian Nihilists escaped\r\nfrom Siberia; Italian revolutionaries; high church dignitaries disguised\r\nin grey suitings; ex-errand boys, who had discovered that with six\r\nstrokes of the pen they could set half London laughing at whom they\r\nwould; raw laddies with the burr yet clinging to their tongues, but\r\nwho we knew would one day have the people dancing to the music of their\r\nwords. Neither wealth, nor birth, nor age, nor position counted. Was a\r\nman interesting, amusing; had he ideas and thoughts of his own? Then he\r\nwas welcome. Men who had come, men who were coming, met there on equal\r\nfooting. Among them, as years ago among my schoolmates, I found my\r\nplace--somewhat to my dissatisfaction. I amused. Much rather would I\r\nhave shocked them by the originality of my views, impressed them with\r\nthe depth of my judgments. They declined to be startled, refused to\r\nbe impressed; instead, they laughed. Nor from these men could I obtain\r\nsympathy in my disappointment.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, you villain!” roared Deleglise's caretaker at me one\r\nevening on entering the kitchen. “How dare you waste your time writing\r\nthis sort of stuff?”\r\n\r\nHe had a copy of the paper containing my “Witch of Moel Sarbod” in his\r\nhand--then some months old. He screwed it up into a ball and flung it in\r\nmy face. “I've only just read it. What did you get for it?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Nothing!” he screamed. “You got off for nothing? You ought to have been\r\nwhipped at the cart's tail!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, come, it's not as bad as that,” suggested old Deleglise.\r\n\r\n“Not bad! There isn't a laugh in it from beginning to end.”\r\n\r\n“There wasn't intended to be,” I interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Why not, you swindler? What were you sent into the world to do? To make\r\nit laugh.”\r\n\r\n“I want to make it think,” I told him.\r\n\r\n“Make it think! Hasn't it got enough to think about? Aren't there ten\r\nthousand penny-a-liners, poets, tragedians, tub-thumpers, long-eared\r\nphilosophers, boring it to death? Who are you to turn up your nose at\r\nyour work and tell the Almighty His own business? You are here to make\r\nus laugh. Get on with your work, you confounded young idiot!”\r\n\r\nUrban Vane was the only one among them who understood me, who agreed\r\nwith me that I was fitted for higher things than merely to minister\r\nto the world's need of laughter. He alone it was who would listen\r\nwith approval to my dreams of becoming a famous tragedian, a writer of\r\nsoul-searching books, of passion-analysing plays. I never saw him laugh\r\nhimself, certainly not at anything funny. “Humour!” he would explain\r\nin his languid drawl, “personally it doesn't amuse me.” One felt its\r\nintroduction into the scheme of life had been an error. He was a large,\r\nfleshy man, with a dreamy, caressing voice and strangely impassive face.\r\nWhere he came from, who he was, nobody knew. Without ever passing a\r\nremark himself that was worth listening to, he, nevertheless, by some\r\nmysterious trick of manner I am unable to explain, soon established\r\nhimself, even throughout that company, where as a rule men found their\r\nproper level, as a silent authority in all contests of wit or argument.\r\nStories at which he listened, bored, fell flat. The _bon mot_ at which\r\nsome faint suggestion of a smile quivered round his clean-shaven lips\r\nwas felt to be the crown of the discussion. I can only conclude his\r\nsecret to have been his magnificent assumption of superiority, added to\r\na sphinx-like impenetrability behind which he could always retire from\r\nany danger of exposure. Subjects about which he knew nothing--and I\r\nhave come to the conclusion they were more numerous than was\r\nsuspected--became in his presence topics outside the radius of\r\ncultivated consideration: one felt ashamed of having introduced them.\r\nHis own subjects--they were few but exclusive--he had the knack of\r\nelevating into intellectual tests: one felt ashamed, reflecting how\r\nlittle one knew about them. Whether he really did possess a charm of\r\nmanner, or whether the sense of his superiority with which he had imbued\r\nme it was that made any condescension he paid me a thing to grasp at, I\r\nam unable to say. Certain it is that when he suggested I should throw\r\nup chorus singing and accompany him into the provinces as manager of a\r\ntheatrical company he was then engaging to run a wonderful drama that\r\nwas going to revolutionise the English stage and educate the English\r\npublic, I allowed myself not a moment for consideration, but accepted\r\nhis proposal with grateful delight.\r\n\r\n“Who is he?” asked Dan. Somehow he had never impressed Dan; but then Dan\r\nwas a fellow to impress whom was slow work. As he himself confessed, he\r\nhad no instinct for character. “I judge,” he would explain, “purely by\r\nobservation.”\r\n\r\n“What does that matter?” was my reply.\r\n\r\n“What does he know about the business?”\r\n\r\n“That's why he wants me.”\r\n\r\n“What do you know about it?”\r\n\r\n“There's not much to know. I can find out.”\r\n\r\n“Take care you don't find out that there's more to know than you think.\r\nWhat is this wonderful play of his?”\r\n\r\n“I haven't seen it yet; I don't think it's finished. It's something from\r\nthe Spanish or the Russian, I'm not sure. I'm to put it into shape\r\nwhen he's done the translation. He wants me to put my name to it as the\r\nadaptor.”\r\n\r\n“Wonder he hasn't asked you to wear his clothes. Has he got any money?”\r\n\r\n“Of course he has money. How can you run a theatrical company without\r\nmoney?”\r\n\r\n“Have you seen the money?”\r\n\r\n“He doesn't carry it about with him in a bag.”\r\n\r\n“I should have thought your ambition to be to act, not to manage.\r\nManagers are to be had cheap enough. Why should he want some one who\r\nknows", " as the\r\nadaptor.”\r\n\r\n“Wonder he hasn't asked you to wear his clothes. Has he got any money?”\r\n\r\n“Of course he has money. How can you run a theatrical company without\r\nmoney?”\r\n\r\n“Have you seen the money?”\r\n\r\n“He doesn't carry it about with him in a bag.”\r\n\r\n“I should have thought your ambition to be to act, not to manage.\r\nManagers are to be had cheap enough. Why should he want some one who\r\nknows nothing about it?”\r\n\r\n“I'm going to act. I'm going to play a leading part.”\r\n\r\n“Great Scott!”\r\n\r\n“He'll do the management really himself; I shall simply advise him. But\r\nhe doesn't want his own name to appear.\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“His people might object.”\r\n\r\n“Who are his people?”\r\n\r\n“How do I know? What a suspicious chap you are.”\r\n\r\nDan shrugged his shoulders. “You are not an actor, you never will be;\r\nyou are not a business man. You've made a start at writing, that's your\r\nproper work. Why not go on with it?”\r\n\r\n“I can't get on with it. That one thing was accepted, and never paid\r\nfor; everything else comes back regularly, just as before. Besides, I\r\ncan go on writing wherever I am.”\r\n\r\n“You've got friends here to help you.”\r\n\r\n“They don't believe I can do anything but write nonsense.”\r\n\r\n“Well, clever nonsense is worth writing. It's better than stodgy sense:\r\nliterature is blocked up with that. Why not follow their advice?”\r\n\r\n“Because I don't believe they are right. I'm not a clown; I don't mean\r\nto be. Because a man has a sense of humour it doesn't follow he has\r\nnothing else. That is only one of my gifts, and by no means the highest.\r\nI have knowledge of human nature, poetry, dramatic instinct. I mean to\r\nprove it to you all. Vane's the only man that understands me.”\r\n\r\nDan lit his pipe. “Have you made up your mind to go?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I have. It's an opportunity that doesn't occur twice.\r\n'There's a tide in the affairs--”\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” interrupted Dan; “I've heard it before. Well, if you've made\r\nup your mind, there's an end of the matter. Good luck to you! You are\r\nyoung, and it's easier to learn things then than later.”\r\n\r\n“You talk,” I answered, “as if you were old enough to be my\r\ngrandfather.”\r\n\r\nHe smiled and laid both hands upon my shoulders. “So I am,” he said,\r\n“quite old enough, little boy Paul. Don't be angry; you'll always be\r\nlittle Paul to me.” He put his hands in his pockets and strolled to the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n“What'll you do?” I enquired. “Will you keep on these rooms?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he replied. “I shall accept an offer that has been made to me to\r\ntake the sub-editorship of a big Yorkshire paper. It is an important\r\nposition and will give me experience.”\r\n\r\n“You'll never be happy mewed up in a provincial town,” I told him. “I\r\nshall want a London address, and I can easily afford it. Let's keep them\r\non together.”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. “It wouldn't be the same thing,” he said.\r\n\r\nSo there came a morning when we said good-bye. Before Dan returned from\r\nthe office I should be gone. They had been pleasant months that we had\r\nspent together in these pretty rooms. Though my life was calling to\r\nme full of hope, I felt the pain of leaving them. Two years is a long\r\nperiod in a young man's life, when the sap is running swiftly. My\r\naffections had already taken root there. The green leaves in summer, in\r\nwinter the bare branches of the square, the sparrows that chirped about\r\nthe window-sills, the quiet peace of the great house, Dan, kindly old\r\nDeleglise: around them my fibres clung, closer than I had known. The\r\nLady of the train: she managed it now less clumsily. Her hands and\r\nfeet had grown smaller, her elbows rounder. I found myself smiling as\r\nI thought of her--one always did smile when one thought of Norah,\r\neverybody did;--of her tomboy ways, her ringing laugh--there were those\r\nwho termed it noisy; her irrepressible frankness--there were times when\r\nit was inconvenient. Would she ever become lady-like, sedate, proper?\r\nOne doubted it. I tried to picture her a wife, the mistress of a house.\r\nI found the smile deepening round my mouth. What a jolly wife she would\r\nmake! I could see her bustling, full of importance; flying into tempers,\r\nlasting possibly for thirty seconds; then calling herself names, saving\r\nall argument by undertaking her own scolding, and doing it well. I\r\nfollowed her to motherhood. What a joke it would be! What would she do\r\nwith them? She would just let them do what they liked with her. She and\r\nthey would be a parcel of children together, she the most excited of\r\nthem all. No; on second thoughts I could detect in her a strong vein of\r\ncommon sense. They would have to mind their p's and q's. I could see her\r\nromping with them, helping them to tear their clothes; but likewise I\r\ncould see her flying after them, bringing back an armful struggling,\r\nbathing it, physicking it. Perhaps she would grow stout, grow grey; but\r\nshe would still laugh more often than sigh, speak her mind, be quick,\r\ngood-tempered Norah to the end. Her character precluded all hope of\r\nsurprise. That, as I told myself, was its defect. About her were none of\r\nthose glorious possibilities that make of some girls charming mysteries.\r\nA woman, said I to myself, should be a wondrous jewel, hiding unknown\r\nlights and shadows. You, my dear Norah--I spoke my thoughts aloud, as\r\nhad become a habit with me: those who live much alone fall into this\r\nway--you are merely a crystal, not shallow--no, I should not call you\r\nshallow by any mans, but transparent.\r\n\r\nWhat would he be, her lover? Some plain, matter-of-fact, business-like\r\nyoung fellow, a good player of cricket and football, fond of his dinner.\r\nWhat a very uninteresting affair the love-making would be! If she liked\r\nhim--well, she would probably tell him so; if she didn't, he would know\r\nit in five minutes.\r\n\r\nAs for inducing her to change her mind, wooing her, cajoling her--I\r\nheard myself laughing at the idea.\r\n\r\nThere came a quick rap at the door. “Come in,” I cried; and she entered.\r\n\r\n“I came to say good-bye to you,” she explained. “I'm just going out.\r\nWhat were you laughing at?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, at an idea that occurred to me.”\r\n\r\n“A funny one?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Tell it me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it was something in connection with yourself. It might offend\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“It wouldn't trouble you much if it did, would it?”\r\n\r\n“No, I don't suppose it would.”\r\n\r\n“Then why not tell me?”\r\n\r\n“I was thinking of your lover.”\r\n\r\nIt did offend her; I thought it would. But she looked really interesting\r\nwhen she was cross. Her grey eyes would flash, and her whole body\r\nquiver. There was a charming spice of danger always about making her\r\ncross.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you think I shall never have one.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, I think you will have a good many.” I had not thought\r\nso before then. I formed the idea for the first time in that moment,\r\nwhile looking straight into her angry face. It was still a childish\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe anger died out of it as it always did within the minute, and she\r\nlaughed. “It would be fun, wouldn't it. I wonder what I should do with\r\nhim? It makes you feel very serious being in love, doesn't it?”\r\n\r\n“Very.”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever been in love?”\r\n\r\nI hesitated for a moment. Then the delight of talking about it overcame\r\nmy fear of being chaffed. Besides, when she felt it, nobody could be\r\nmore delightfully sympathetic. I determined to adventure it.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered", ". “It would be fun, wouldn't it. I wonder what I should do with\r\nhim? It makes you feel very serious being in love, doesn't it?”\r\n\r\n“Very.”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever been in love?”\r\n\r\nI hesitated for a moment. Then the delight of talking about it overcame\r\nmy fear of being chaffed. Besides, when she felt it, nobody could be\r\nmore delightfully sympathetic. I determined to adventure it.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “ever since I was a boy. If you are going to be\r\nfoolish,” I added, for I saw the laugh before it came, “I shan't talk to\r\nyou about it.”\r\n\r\n“I'm not--I won't, really,” she pleaded, making her face serious again.\r\n“What is she like?”\r\n\r\nI took from my breast pocket Barbara's photograph, and handed it to her\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\n“Is she really as beautiful as that?” she asked, gazing at it evidently\r\nfascinated.\r\n\r\n“More so,” I assured her. “Her expression is the most beautiful part of\r\nher. Those are only her features.”\r\n\r\nShe sighed. “I wish I was beautiful.”\r\n\r\n“You are at an awkward age,” I told her. “It is impossible to say what\r\nyou are going to be like.”\r\n\r\n“Mamma was a lovely woman, everybody says so; and Tom I call awfully\r\nhandsome. Perhaps I'll be better when I'm filled out a bit more.” A\r\nsmall Venetian mirror hung between the two windows; she glanced up into\r\nit. “It's my nose that irritates me,” she said. She rubbed it viciously,\r\nas if she would rub it out.\r\n\r\n“Some people admire snub noses,” I explained to her.\r\n\r\n“No, really?”\r\n\r\n“Tennyson speaks of them as 'tip-tilted like the petals of a rose.'”\r\n\r\n“How nice of him! Do you think he meant my sort?” She rubbed it again,\r\nbut in a kinder fashion; then looked again at Barbara's photograph. “Who\r\nis she?”\r\n\r\n“She was Miss Hasluck,” I answered; “she is the Countess Huescar now.\r\nShe was married last summer.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I remember; you told us about her. You were children together.\r\nBut what's the good of your being in love with her if she's married?”\r\n\r\n“It makes my whole life beautiful.”\r\n\r\n“Wanting somebody you can't have?”\r\n\r\n“I don't want her.”\r\n\r\n“You said you were in love with her.”\r\n\r\n“So I am.”\r\n\r\nShe handed me back the photograph, and I replaced it in my pocket.\r\n\r\n“I don't understand that sort of love,” she said. “If I loved anybody I\r\nshould want to have them with me always.\r\n\r\n“She is with me always,” I answered, “in my thoughts.” She looked at me\r\nwith her clear grey eyes. I found myself blinking. Something seemed\r\nto be slipping from me, something I did not want to lose. I remember a\r\nsimilar sensation once at the moment of waking from a strange, delicious\r\ndream to find the sunlight pouring in upon me through an open window.\r\n\r\n“That isn't being in love,” she said. “That's being in love with the\r\nidea of being in love. That's the way I used to go to balls”--she\r\nlaughed--“in front of the glass. You caught me once, do you remember?”\r\n\r\n“And was it not sweeter,” I argued, “the imagination? You were the belle\r\nof the evening; you danced divinely every dance, were taken in to supper\r\nby the Lion. In reality you trod upon your partner's toes, bumped and\r\nwere bumped, were left a wallflower more than half the time, had a\r\nheadache the next day. Were not the dream balls the more delightful?”\r\n\r\n“No, they weren't,” she answered without the slightest hesitation. “One\r\nreal dance, when at last it came, was worth the whole of them. Oh, I\r\nknow, I've heard you talking, all of you--of the faces that you see in\r\ndreams and that are ever so much more beautiful than the faces that you\r\nsee when you're awake; of the wonderful songs that nobody ever sings,\r\nthe wonderful pictures that nobody ever paints, and all the rest of it.\r\nI don't believe a word of it. It's tommyrot!”\r\n\r\n“I wish you wouldn't use slang.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know what I mean. What is the proper word? Give it me.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you mean cant,” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“No, I don't. Cant is something that you don't believe in yourself. It's\r\ntommyrot: there isn't any other word. When I'm in love it will be with\r\nsomething that is real.”\r\n\r\nI was feeling angry with her. “I know just what he will be like. He will\r\nbe a good-natured, commonplace--”\r\n\r\n“Whatever he is,” she interrupted, “he'll be alive, and he'll want me\r\nand I shall want him. Dreams are silly. I prefer being up.” She\r\nclapped her hands. “That's it.” Then, silent, she looked at me with an\r\nexpression of new interest. “I've been wondering and wondering what it\r\nwas: you are not really awake yet. You've never got up.”\r\n\r\nI laughed at her whimsical way of putting it; but at the back of my\r\nbrain was a troubled idea that perhaps she was revealing to me the\r\ntruth. And if so, what would “waking up,” as she termed it, be like? A\r\nflash of memory recalled to me that summer evening upon Barking Bridge,\r\nwhen, as it had seemed to me, the little childish Paul had slipped away\r\nfrom me, leaving me lonely and bewildered to find another Self. Was my\r\nboyhood in like manner now falling from me? I found myself clinging to\r\nit with vague terror. Its thoughts, its feelings--dreams: they had grown\r\nsweet to me; must I lose them? This cold, unknown, new Self, waiting to\r\nreceive me: I shrank away from it with fear.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, I think you will be rather nice when you wake up.”\r\n\r\nHer words recalled me to myself. “Perhaps I never shall wake up,” I\r\nsaid. “I don't want to wake up.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but one can't go on dreaming all one's life,” she laughed. “You'll\r\nwake up, and fall in love with somebody real.” She came across to me,\r\nand taking the lapels of my coat in both her hands, gave me a vigorous\r\nshake. “I hope she'll be somebody nice. I am rather afraid.”\r\n\r\n“You seem to think me a fool!” I was still angry with her, without quite\r\nknowing why.\r\n\r\nShe shook me again. “You know I don't. But it isn't the nice people that\r\ntake best care of themselves. Tom can't. I have to take care of him.”\r\n\r\nI laughed.\r\n\r\n“I do, really. You should hear me scold him. I like taking care of\r\npeople. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand. It was white now and shapely, but one could not\r\nhave called it small. Strong it felt and firm as it gripped mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nAND HOW CAME BACK AGAIN.\r\n\r\nI left London, the drums beating in my heart, the flags waving in my\r\nbrain. Somewhat more than a year later, one foggy wet December evening,\r\nI sneaked back to it defeated--ah, that is a small thing, capable of\r\nredress--disgraced. I returned to it as to a hiding-place where, lost\r\nin the crowd, I might waste my days unnoticed until such time as I could\r\nsummon up sufficient resolution to put an end to my dead life. I had\r\nbeen ambitious--dwelling again amid the bitterness of the months that\r\nfollowed my return, I write in the past tense. I had been eager to make\r\na name, a position for myself. But were I to claim no higher aim, I\r\nshould be doing injustice to my blood--to the great-souled gentleman\r\nwhose whole life had been an ode to honour, to her of simple faith who\r\nhad known no other prayer to teach me than the childish cry, “God help\r\nme to be good!” I had wished to be a great man, but it was to have\r\nbeen a great good man. The world was to have", "a name, a position for myself. But were I to claim no higher aim, I\r\nshould be doing injustice to my blood--to the great-souled gentleman\r\nwhose whole life had been an ode to honour, to her of simple faith who\r\nhad known no other prayer to teach me than the childish cry, “God help\r\nme to be good!” I had wished to be a great man, but it was to have\r\nbeen a great good man. The world was to have admired me, but to have\r\nrespected me also. I was to have been the knight without fear, but,\r\nrarer yet, without reproach--Galahad, not Launcelot. I had learnt myself\r\nto be a feeble, backboneless fighter, conquered by the first serious\r\nassault of evil, a creature of mean fears, slave to every crack of the\r\ndevil's whip, a feeder with swine.\r\n\r\nUrban Vane I had discovered to be a common swindler. His play he had\r\nstolen from the desk of a well-known dramatist whose acquaintance he had\r\nmade in Deleglise's kitchen. The man had fallen ill, and Vane had been\r\nconstant in his visits. Partly recovering, the man had gone abroad to\r\nItaly. Had he died there, as at the time was expected, the robbery might\r\nnever have come to light. News reached us in a small northern town that\r\nhe had taken a fresh lease of life and was on his way back to England.\r\nThen it was that Vane with calm indifference, smoking his cigar over\r\na bottle of wine to which he had invited me, told me the bald truth,\r\nadorning it with some touches of wit. Had the recital come upon me\r\nsooner, I might have acted differently; but six months' companionship\r\nwith Urban Vane, if it had not, by grace of the Lord, destroyed the\r\nroots of whatever flower of manhood might have been implanted in me, had\r\nmost certainly withered its leaves.\r\n\r\nThe man was clever. That he was not clever enough to perceive from the\r\nbeginning what he has learnt since: that honesty is the best policy--at\r\nleast, for men with brains--remains somewhat of a mystery to me. Where\r\nonce he made his hundreds among shady ways, he now, I suppose, makes his\r\nthousands in the broad daylight of legitimate enterprise. Chicanery in\r\nthe blood, one might imagine, has to be worked out. Urban Vanes are to\r\nbe found in all callings. They commence as scamps; years later, to one's\r\nastonishment, one finds them ornaments to their profession. Wild oats\r\nare of various quality, according to the soil from which they are\r\npreserved. We sow them in our various ways.\r\n\r\nAt first I stormed. Vane sat with an amused smile upon his lips and\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\n“Your language, my dear Kelver,” he replied, my vocabulary exhausted,\r\n“might wound me were I able to accept you as an authority upon this\r\nvexed question of morals. With the rest of the world you preach one\r\nthing and practise another. I have noticed it so often. It is perhaps\r\nsad, but the preaching has ceased to interest me. You profess to be\r\nvery indignant with me for making use of another man's ideas. It is done\r\nevery day. You yourself were quite ready to take credit not due to you.\r\nFor months we have been travelling with this play: 'Drama, in five acts,\r\nby Mr. Horace Moncrieff.' Not more than two hundred lines of it are your\r\nown--excellent lines, I admit, but they do not constitute the play.”\r\n\r\nThis aspect of the affair had not occurred to me. “But you asked me to\r\nput my name to it,” I stammered. “You said you did not want your own to\r\nappear--for private reasons. You made a point of it.”\r\n\r\nHe waved away the smoke from his cigar. “The man you are posing as would\r\nnever have put his name to work not his own. You never hesitated; on the\r\ncontrary, you jumped at the chance of so easy an opening to your career\r\nas playwright. My need, as you imagined it, was your opportunity.”\r\n\r\n“But you said it was from the French,” I argued; “you had merely\r\ntranslated it, I adapted it. I don't defend the custom, but it is the\r\ncustom: the man who adapts a play calls himself the author. They all do\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” he answered. “It has always amused me. Our sick friend\r\nhimself, whom I am sure we are both delighted to welcome back to\r\nlife, has done it more than once, and made a very fair profit on the\r\ntransaction. Indeed, from internal evidence, I am strongly of opinion\r\nthat this present play is a case in point. Well, chickens come home to\r\nroost: I adapt from him. What is the difference?”\r\n\r\n“Simply this,” he continued, pouring himself out another glass of wine,\r\n“that whereas, owing to the anomalous state of the copyright laws,\r\nstealing from the foreign author is legal and commendable, against\r\nstealing from the living English author there is a certain prejudice.”\r\n\r\n“And the consequences, I am afraid, you will find somewhat unpleasant,”\r\n I suggested.\r\n\r\nHe laughed: it was not a frivolity to which he was prone. “You mean, my\r\ndear Kelver that you will.”\r\n\r\n“Don't look so dumbfounded,” he went on. “You cannot be so stupid as you\r\nare pretending to be. The original manuscript at the Lord Chamberlain's\r\noffice is in your handwriting. You knew our friend as well as I did,\r\nand visited him. Why, the whole tour has been under your management.\r\nYou have arranged everything--most excellently; I have been quite\r\nsurprised.”\r\n\r\nMy anger came later. For the moment, the sudden light blinded me to\r\neverything but fear.\r\n\r\n“But you told me,” I cried, “it was only a matter of form, that you\r\nwanted to keep your name out of it because--”\r\n\r\nHe was looking at me with an expression of genuine astonishment. My\r\nwords began to appear humorous even to myself. I found it difficult to\r\nbelieve I had been the fool I was now seeing myself to have been.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry,” he said, “I am really sorry. I took you for a man of the\r\nworld. I thought you merely did not wish to know anything.”\r\n\r\nStill, to my shame, fear was the thing uppermost in my heart. “You are\r\nnot going to put it all on to me?” I pleaded.\r\n\r\nHe had risen. He laid his hand upon my shoulder. Instead of flinging it\r\noff, I was glad of its kindly pressure. He was the only man to whom I\r\ncould look for help.\r\n\r\n“Don't take it so seriously,” he said. “He will merely think the\r\nmanuscript has been lost. As likely as not, he will be unable to\r\nremember whether he wrote it or merely thought of writing it. No one in\r\nthe company will say anything: it isn't their business. We must set to\r\nwork. I had altered it a good deal before you saw it, and changed all\r\nthe names of the characters. We will retain the third act: it is the\r\nonly thing of real value in the play. The situation is not original; you\r\nhave as much right to dish it up as he had. In a fortnight we will have\r\nthe whole thing so different that if he saw it himself he would only\r\nimagine we had got hold of the idea and had forestalled him.”\r\n\r\nThere were moments during the next few weeks when I listened to the\r\nvoice of my good angel, when I saw clearly that even from the lowest\r\npoint of view he was giving me sound advice. I would go to the man, tell\r\nhim frankly the whole truth.\r\n\r\nBut Vane never left my elbow. Suspecting, I suppose, he gave me clearly\r\nto understand that if I did so, I must expect no mercy from him. My\r\nstory, denounced by him as an outrageous lie, would be regarded as the\r\nfunk-inspired subterfuge of a young rogue. At the best I should handicap\r\nmyself with suspicion that would last me throughout my career. On the\r\nother hand, what harm had we done? Presented in some twenty or so small\r\ntowns, where it would soon be forgotten, a play something like.", "to understand that if I did so, I must expect no mercy from him. My\r\nstory, denounced by him as an outrageous lie, would be regarded as the\r\nfunk-inspired subterfuge of a young rogue. At the best I should handicap\r\nmyself with suspicion that would last me throughout my career. On the\r\nother hand, what harm had we done? Presented in some twenty or so small\r\ntowns, where it would soon be forgotten, a play something like. Most\r\nplays were something like. Our friend would produce his version and\r\nreap a rich harvest; ours would disappear. If by any unlikely chance\r\ndiscussion should arise, the advertisement would be to his advantage. So\r\nsoon as possible we would replace it by a new piece altogether. A young\r\nman of my genius could surely write something better than hotch-potch\r\nsuch as this; experience was all that I had lacked. As regarded\r\none's own conscience, was not the world's honesty a mere question of\r\nconvention? Had he been a young man, and had we diddled him out of his\r\nplay for a ten-pound note, we should have been applauded as sharp men of\r\nbusiness. The one commandment of the world was: Don't get found out. The\r\nwhole trouble, left alone, would sink and fade. Later, we should tell it\r\nas a good joke--and be laughed with.\r\n\r\nSo I fell from mine own esteem. Vane helping me--and he had brains--I\r\nset feverishly to work. I am glad to remember that every line I wrote\r\nwas born in misery. I tried to persuade Vane to let me make a new\r\nplay altogether, which I offered to give him for nothing. He expressed\r\nhimself as grateful, but his frequently declared belief in my dramatic\r\ntalent failed to induce his acceptance.\r\n\r\n“Later on, my dear Kelver,” was his reply. “For the present this is\r\ndoing very well. Going on as we are, we shall soon improve it out of all\r\nrecognition, while at the same time losing nothing that is essential.\r\nAll your ideas are excellent.”\r\n\r\nBy the end of about three weeks we had got together a concoction that,\r\nso far as dialogue and characters were concerned, might be said to\r\nbe our own. There was good work in it, here and there. Under other\r\nconditions I might have been proud of much that I had written. As it\r\nwas, I experienced only the terror of the thief dodging the constable:\r\nmy cleverness might save me; it afforded me no further satisfaction.\r\nMy humour, when I heard the people laughing at it, I remembered I had\r\nforged listening in vague fear to every creak upon the stairs, wondering\r\nin what form discovery might come upon me. There was one speech,\r\naddressed by the hero to the villain: “Yes, I admit it; I do love her.\r\nBut there is that which I love better--my self-respect!” Stepping down\r\nto the footlights and slapping his chest (which according to stage\r\nconvention would appear to be a sort of moral jewel-box bursting with\r\nassorted virtues), our juvenile lead--a gentleman who led a somewhat\r\nrabbit-like existence, perpetually diving down openings to avoid service\r\nof writs, at the instance of his wife, for alimony--would invariably\r\nbring down the house upon this sentiment. Every night, listening to the\r\napplause, I would shudder, recalling how I had written it with burning\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\nThere was a character in the piece, a vicious old man, that from the\r\nbeginning Vane had wanted me to play. I had disliked the part and\r\nhad refused, choosing instead to act a high-souled countryman, in the\r\nportrayal of whose irreproachable emotions I had taken pleasure. Vane\r\nnow renewed his arguments, and my power of resistance seeming to have\r\ndeparted from me, I accepted the exchange. Certainly the old gentleman's\r\nscenes went with more snap, but at a cost of further degradation to\r\nmyself. Upon an older actor the effect might have been harmless, but the\r\ngrowing tree springs back less surely; I found myself taking pleasure\r\nin the coarse laughter that rewarded my suggestive leers, calling up all\r\nthe evil in my nature to help me in the development of fresh “business.”\r\n Vane was enthusiastic in his praises, generous with his assistance.\r\nUnder his tuition I succeeded in making the part as unpleasant as we\r\ndared. I had genius, so Vane told me; I understood so much of human\r\nnature. One proof of the moral deterioration creeping over me was that I\r\nwas beginning to like Vane.\r\n\r\nLooking back at the man as I see him plainly now, a very ordinary scamp,\r\nhis pretension not even amusing, I find it difficult to present him as\r\nhe appeared to my boyish eyes. He was well educated and well read. He\r\ngave himself the airs of a superior being by freak of fate compelled to\r\nabide in a world of inferior creatures. To live among them in comfort it\r\nwas necessary for him to outwardly conform to their conventions but to\r\nrespect their reasoning would have been beneath him. To accept\r\ntheir laws as binding on one's own conscience was, using the common\r\nexpression, to give oneself away, to confess oneself commonplace. Every\r\ndecent instinct a man might own to was proof in Vane's eyes of his being\r\n“suburban,” “bourgeois”--everything that was unintellectual. It was the\r\nfirst time I had heard this sort of talk. Vane was one of the pioneers\r\nof the movement, which has since become somewhat tiresome. To laugh at\r\nit is easy to a man of the world; boys are impressed by it. From him\r\nI first heard the now familiar advocacy of pure Hedonism. Pan, enticed\r\nfrom his dark groves, was to sit upon Olympus.\r\n\r\nMy lower nature rose within me to proclaim the foolish chatterer as\r\na prophet. So life was not as I had been taught--a painful struggle\r\nbetween good and evil. There was no such thing as evil; the senseless\r\nepithet was a libel upon Nature. Not through wearisome repression, but\r\nrather through joyous expression of the animal lay advancement.\r\n\r\nVillains--workers in wrong for aesthetic pleasure of the art--are useful\r\ncharacters in fiction; in real life they do not exist. I am convinced\r\nthe man believed most of the rubbish he talked. Since the time of which\r\nI write he has done some service to the world. I understand he is an\r\nexcellent husband and father, a considerate master, a delightful\r\nhost. He intended, I have no doubt, to improve me, to enlarge my\r\nunderstanding, to free me from soul-stifling bondage of convention. Not\r\nto credit him with this well-meaning intention would be to assume\r\nhim something quite inhuman, to bestow upon him a dignity beyond his\r\ndeserts. I find it easier to regard him merely as a fool.\r\n\r\nOur leading lady was a handsome but coarse woman, somewhat\r\nover-developed. Starting life as a music-hall singer, she had married\r\na small tradesman in the south of London. Some three or four years\r\nprevious, her Juno-like charms had turned the head of a youthful\r\nnovelist--a refined, sensitive man, of whom great things in literature\r\nhad been expected, and, judging from his earlier work, not unreasonably.\r\nHe had run away with her, and eventually married her; the scandal was\r\nstill fresh. Already she had repented of her bargain. These women regard\r\ntheir infatuated lovers merely as steps in the social ladder, and he\r\nhad failed to appreciably advance her. Under her demoralising spell his\r\nambition had died in him. He no longer wrote, no longer took interest\r\nin anything beyond his own debasement. He was with us in the company,\r\nplaying small parts, and playing them badly; he would have remained with\r\nus as bill-poster rather than have been sent away.\r\n\r\nVane planned to bring this woman and myself together. To her he pictured\r\nme a young gentleman of means, a coming author, who would soon be\r\nearning an income sufficient to keep her in every luxury. To me he\r\nhinted that she had fallen in love with me. I was never attracted to\r\nher by any feeling stronger than the admiration with which one views a\r\nhandsome animal. It was my vanity upon which he worked. He envied me;\r\nany man would envy", "Vane planned to bring this woman and myself together.

It was my vanity upon which he worked. He envied me;\r\nany man would envy me; experience of life was what I needed to complete\r\nmy genius. The great intellects of this earth must learn all lessons,\r\neven at the cost of suffering to themselves and others.\r\n\r\nAs years before I had laboured to acquire a liking for cigars and\r\nwhiskey, deeming it an accomplishment necessary to a literary career, so\r\npainstakingly I now applied myself to the cultivation of a pretty taste\r\nin passion. According to the literature, fictional and historical, Vane\r\nwas kind enough to supply me with, men of note were invariably sad dogs.\r\nThat my temperament was not that of the sad dog, that I lacked instinct\r\nand inclination for the part, appeared to this young idiot of whom I am\r\nwriting in the light of a defect. That her languishing glances irritated\r\nrather than maddened me, that the occasional covert pressure of her hot,\r\nthick hand left me cold, I felt a reproach to my manhood. I would fall\r\nin love with her. Surely my blood was red like other men's. Besides, was\r\nI not an artist, and was not profligacy the hall-mark of the artist?\r\n\r\nBut one grows tired of the confessional. Fate saved me from playing\r\nthe part Vane had assigned me in this vulgar comedy, dragged me from my\r\nentanglement, flung me on my feet again. She was a little brusque in the\r\nprocess; but I do not feel inclined to blame the kind lady for that. The\r\nmud was creeping upward fast, and a quick hand must needs be rough.\r\n\r\nOur dramatic friend produced his play sooner than we had expected. It\r\ncrept out that something very like it had been seen in the Provinces.\r\nArgument followed, enquiries were set on foot. “It will blow over,” said\r\nVane. But it seemed to be blowing our way.\r\n\r\nThe salaries, as a rule, were paid by me on Friday night. Vane, in the\r\ncourse of the evening, would bring me the money for me to distribute\r\nafter the performance. We were playing in the north of Ireland. I had\r\nnot seen Vane all that day. So soon as I had changed my clothes I left\r\nmy dressing-room to seek him. The box-office keeper, meeting me, put a\r\nnote into my hand. It was short and to the point. Vane had pocketed the\r\nevening's takings, and had left by the seven-fifty train! He regretted\r\ncausing inconvenience, but life was replete with small comedies; the\r\nwise man attached no seriousness to them. We should probably meet again\r\nand enjoy a laugh over our experiences.\r\n\r\nSome rumour had got about. I looked up from the letter to find myself\r\nsurrounded by suspicious faces. With dry lips I told them the truth.\r\nOnly they happened not to regard it as the truth. Vane throughout\r\nhad contrived cleverly to them I was the manager, the sole\r\nperson responsible. My wearily spoken explanations were to them\r\nincomprehensible lies. The quarter of an hour might have been worse for\r\nme had I been sufficiently alive to understand or care what they were\r\nsaying. A dull, listless apathy had come over me. I felt the scene only\r\nstupid, ridiculous, tiresome. There was some talk of giving me “a damned\r\ngood hiding.” I doubt whether I should have known till the next morning\r\nwhether the suggestion had been carried out or not. I gathered that the\r\ntrue history of the play, the reason for the sudden alterations, had\r\nbeen known to them all along. They appeared to have reserved their\r\nvirtuous indignation till this evening. As explanation of my apparent\r\nsleepiness, somebody, whether in kindness to me or not I cannot say,\r\nsuggested I was drunk. Fortunately, it carried conviction. No further\r\ntrains left the town that night; I was allowed to depart. A deputation\r\npromised to be round at my lodgings early in the morning.\r\n\r\nOur leading lady had left the theatre immediately on the fall of the\r\ncurtain; it was not necessary for her to wait, her husband acting as her\r\nbusiness man. On reaching my rooms, I found her sitting by the fire.\r\nIt reminded me that our agent in advance having fallen ill, her husband\r\nhad, at her suggestion, been appointed in his place, and had left us on\r\nthe Wednesday to make the necessary preparations in the next town on our\r\nlist. I thought that perhaps she had come round for her money, and the\r\nidea amused me.\r\n\r\n“Well?” she said, with her one smile. I had been doing my best for some\r\nmonths to regard it as soul-consuming, but without any real success.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I answered. It bored me, her being there. I wanted to be alone.\r\n\r\n“You don't seem overjoyed to see me. What's the matter with you? What's\r\nhappened?”\r\n\r\nI laughed. “Vane's bolted and taken the week's money with him.”\r\n\r\n“The beast!” she said. “I knew he was that sort. What ever made you take\r\nup with him? Will it make much difference to you?”\r\n\r\n“It makes a difference all round,” I replied. “There's no money to pay\r\nany of you. There's nothing to pay your fares back to London.”\r\n\r\nShe had risen. “Here, let me understand this,” she said. “Are you the\r\nrich mug Vane's been representing you to be, or only his accomplice?”\r\n\r\n“The mug and the accomplice both,” I answered, “without the rich.\r\nIt's his tour. He put my name to it because he didn't want his own to\r\nappear--for family reasons. It's his play; he stole it--”\r\n\r\nShe interrupted me with a whistle. “I thought it looked a bit fishy, all\r\nthose alterations. But such funny things do happen in this profession!\r\nStole it, did he?”\r\n\r\n“The whole thing in manuscript. I put my name to it for the same\r\nreason--he didn't want his own to appear.”\r\n\r\nShe dropped into her chair and laughed--a good-tempered laugh, loud and\r\nlong. “Well, I'm damned!” she said. “The first man who has ever taken me\r\nin. I should never have signed if I had thought it was his show. I could\r\nsee the sort he was with half an eye.” She jumped up from the chair.\r\n“Here, let me get out of this,” she said. “I just looked in to know what\r\ntime to-morrow; I'd forgotten. You needn't say I came.”\r\n\r\nHer hand upon the door, laughter seized her again, so that for support\r\nshe had to lean against the wall.\r\n\r\n“Do you know why I really did come?” she said. “You'll guess when you\r\ncome to think it over, so I may as well tell you. It's a bit of a\r\njoke. I came to say 'yes' to what you asked me last night. Have you\r\nforgotten?”\r\n\r\nI stared at her. Last night! It seemed a long while ago--so very\r\nunimportant what I might have said.\r\n\r\nShe laughed again. “So help me! if you haven't. Well, you asked me to\r\nrun away with you--that's all, to let our two souls unite. Damned lucky\r\nI took a day to think it over! Good-night.”\r\n\r\n“Good-night,” I answered, without moving. I was gripping a chair to\r\nprevent myself from rushing at her, pushing her out of the room, and\r\nlocking the door. I wanted to be alone.\r\n\r\nI heard her turn the handle. “Got a pound or two to carry you over?” It\r\nwas a woman's voice.\r\n\r\nI put my hand into my pocket. “One pound seventeen,” I answered,\r\ncounting it. “It will pay my fare to London--or buy me a dinner and a\r\nsecond-hand revolver. I haven't quite decided yet.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you get back and pull yourself together,” she said. “You're only a\r\nkid. Good-night", " alone.\r\n\r\nI heard her turn the handle. “Got a pound or two to carry you over?” It\r\nwas a woman's voice.\r\n\r\nI put my hand into my pocket. “One pound seventeen,” I answered,\r\ncounting it. “It will pay my fare to London--or buy me a dinner and a\r\nsecond-hand revolver. I haven't quite decided yet.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you get back and pull yourself together,” she said. “You're only a\r\nkid. Good-night.”\r\n\r\nI put a few things into a small bag and walked thirty miles that night\r\ninto Belfast. Arrived in London, I took a lodging in Deptford, where\r\nI was least likely to come in contact with any face I had ever seen\r\nbefore. I maintained myself by giving singing lessons at sixpence the\r\nhalf-hour, evening lessons in French and German (the Lord forgive me!)\r\nto ambitious shop-boys at eighteen pence a week, making up tradesmen's\r\nbooks. A few articles of jewellery I had retained enabled me to tide\r\nover bad periods. For some four months I existed there, never going\r\noutside the neighbourhood. Occasionally, wandering listlessly about\r\nthe streets, some object, some vista, would strike me by reason of its\r\nfamiliarity. Then I would turn and hasten back into my grave of dim,\r\nweltering streets.\r\n\r\nOf thoughts, emotions, during these dead days I was unconscious.\r\nSomewhere in my brain they may have been stirring, contending; but\r\nmyself I lived as in a long, dull dream. I ate, and drank, and woke,\r\nand slept, and walked and walked, and lounged by corners; staring by the\r\nhour together, seeing nothing.\r\n\r\nIt has surprised me since to find the scenes I must then have witnessed\r\nphotographed so clearly on my mind. Tragedies, dramas, farces, played\r\nbefore me in that teeming underworld--the scenes present themselves to\r\nme distinct, complete; yet I have no recollection of ever having seen\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI fell ill. It must have been some time in April, but I kept no count of\r\ndays. Nobody came near me, nobody knew of me. I occupied a room at\r\nthe top of a huge block of workmen's dwellings. A woman who kept a\r\nsecond-hand store had lent me for a shilling a week a few articles of\r\nfurniture. Lying upon my chair-bedstead, I listened to the shrill sounds\r\naround me, that through the light and darkness never ceased. A pint of\r\nmilk, left each morning on the stone landing, kept me alive. I would\r\nwait for the man's descending footsteps, then crawl to the door. I hoped\r\nI was going to die, regretting my returning strength, the desire for\r\nfood that drove me out into the streets again.\r\n\r\nOne night, a week or two after my partial recovery, I had wandered on\r\nand on for hour after hour. The breaking dawn recalled me to myself. I\r\nwas outside the palings of a park. In the faint shadowy light it looked\r\nstrange and unfamiliar. I was too tired to walk further. I scrambled\r\nover the low wooden fencing, and reaching a seat, dropped down and fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nI was sitting in a sunny avenue; birds were singing joyously, bright\r\nflowers were all around me. Norah was beside me, her frank, sweet eyes\r\nwere looking into mine; they were full of tenderness, mingled with\r\nwonder. It was a delightful dream: I felt myself smiling.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I started to my feet. Norah's strong hand drew me down again.\r\n\r\nI was in the broad walk, Regent's Park, where, I remembered, Norah often\r\nwalked before breakfast. A park-keeper, the only other human creature\r\nwithin sight, was eyeing me suspiciously. I saw myself--without a\r\nlooking-glass--unkempt, ragged. My intention was to run, but Norah was\r\nholding me by the arm. Savagely I tried to shake her off. I was weak\r\nfrom my recent illness, and, I suppose, half starved; it angered me\r\nto learn she was the stronger of the two. In spite of my efforts, she\r\ndragged me back.\r\n\r\nAshamed of my weakness, ashamed of everything about me, I burst into\r\ntears; and that of course made me still more ashamed. To add to my\r\ndiscomfort, I had no handkerchief. Holding me with one hand--it was\r\nquite sufficient--Norah produced her own, and wiped my eyes. The\r\npark-keeper, satisfied, I suppose, that at all events I was not\r\ndangerous, with a grin passed on.\r\n\r\n“Where have you been, and what have you been doing?” asked Norah.\r\nShe still retained her grip upon me, and in her grey eyes was quiet\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nSo, with my face turned away from her, I told her the whole miserable\r\nstory, taking strange satisfaction in exaggerating, if anything, my own\r\nshare of the disgrace. My recital ended, I sat staring down the long,\r\nshadow-freckled way, and for awhile there was no sound but the chirping\r\nof the sparrows.\r\n\r\nThen behind me I heard a smothered laugh. It was impossible to imagine\r\nit could come from Norah. I turned quickly to see who had stolen upon\r\nus. It was Norah who was laughing; though to do her justice she was\r\ntrying to suppress it, holding her handkerchief to her face. It was of\r\nno use, it would out; she abandoned the struggle, and gave way to it. It\r\nastonished the sparrows into silence; they stood in a row upon the low\r\niron border and looked at one another.\r\n\r\n“I am glad you think it funny,” I said.\r\n\r\n“But it is funny,” she persisted. “Don't say you have lost your sense\r\nof humour, Paul; it was the one real thing you possessed. You were so\r\ncocky--you don't know how cocky you were! Everybody was a fool but\r\nVane; nobody else but he appreciated you at your true worth. You and he\r\nbetween you were going to reform the stage, to educate the public,\r\nto put everything and everybody to rights. I am awfully sorry for all\r\nyou've gone through; but now that it is over, can't you see yourself\r\nthat it is funny?”\r\n\r\nFaintly, dimly, this aspect of the case, for the very first time, began\r\nto present itself to me; but I should have preferred Norah to have been\r\nimpressed by its tragedy.\r\n\r\n“That is not all,” I said. “I nearly ran away with another man's wife.”\r\n\r\nI was glad to notice that sobered her somewhat. “Nearly? Why not quite?”\r\n she asked more seriously.\r\n\r\n“She thought I was some young idiot with money,” I replied bitterly,\r\npleased with the effect I had produced. “Vane had told her a pack of\r\nlies. When she found out I was only a poor devil, ruined, disgraced,\r\nwithout a sixpence---” I made a gesture expressive of eloquent contempt\r\nfor female nature generally.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry,” said Norah; “I told you you would fall in love with\r\nsomething real.”\r\n\r\nHer words irritated me, unreasonably, I confess. “In love!” I replied;\r\n“good God, I was never in love with her!”\r\n\r\n“Then why did you nearly run away with her?”\r\n\r\nI was wishing now I had not mentioned the matter; it promised to be\r\ndifficult of explanation. “I don't know,” I replied irritably. “I\r\nthought she was in love with me. She was very beautiful--at least, other\r\npeople seemed to think she was. Artists are not like ordinary men. You\r\nmust live--understand life, before you can teach it to others. When a\r\nbeautiful woman is in love with you--or pretends to be, you--you must\r\nsay something. You can't stand like a fool and--”\r\n\r\nAgain her laughter interrupted me; this time she made no attempt to\r\nhide it. The sparrows chirped angrily, and flew off to continue their\r\nconversation somewhere where there would be less noise.\r\n\r\n“You are the biggest baby, Paul,” she said, so soon as she could speak,\r\n“I ever heard of.” She seized me by the shoulders, and turned me round.\r\n“If you weren't looking so ill and miserable, I would shake you, Paul,\r\ntill there wasn't a bit of", "Again her laughter interrupted me; this time she made no attempt to\r\nhide it. The sparrows chirped angrily, and flew off to continue their\r\nconversation somewhere where there would be less noise.\r\n\r\n“You are the biggest baby, Paul,” she said, so soon as she could speak,\r\n“I ever heard of.” She seized me by the shoulders, and turned me round.\r\n“If you weren't looking so ill and miserable, I would shake you, Paul,\r\ntill there wasn't a bit of breath left in your body.”\r\n\r\n“How much money do you owe?” she asked--“to the people in the company\r\nand anybody else, I mean--roughly?”\r\n\r\n“About a hundred and fifty pounds,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Then if you rest day or night, Paul, till you have paid that hundred\r\nand fifty--every penny of it--I'll think you the meanest cad in London!”\r\n\r\nHer grey eyes were flashing quite alarmingly. I felt almost afraid of\r\nher. She could be so vehement at times.\r\n\r\n“But how can I?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Go straight home,” she commanded, “and write something funny: an\r\narticle, story--anything you like; only mind that it is funny. Post it\r\nto me to-morrow, at the latest. Dan is in London, editing a new weekly.\r\nI'll have it copied out and sent to him. I shan't say who it is from. I\r\nshall merely ask him to read it and reply, at once. If you've a grain\r\nof grit left in you, you'll write something that he will be glad to have\r\nand to pay for. Pawn that ring on your finger and get yourself a\r\ngood breakfast”--it was my mother's wedding-ring, the only piece of\r\ndispensable property I had not parted with--“_she_ won't mind helping\r\nyou. But nobody else is going to--except yourself.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at her watch. “I must be off.” She turned again. “There\r\nis something I was forgetting. B--“--she mentioned the name of the\r\ndramatist whose play Vane had stolen--“has been looking for you for\r\nthe last three months. If you hadn't been an idiot you might have saved\r\nyourself a good deal of trouble. He is quite certain it was Vane stole\r\nthe manuscript. He asked the nurse to bring it to him an hour after\r\nVane had left the house, and it couldn't be found. Besides, the man's\r\ncharacter is well known. And so is yours. I won't tell it you,” she\r\nlaughed; “anyhow, it isn't that of a knave.”\r\n\r\nShe made a step towards me, then changed her mind. “No,” she said, “I\r\nshan't shake hands with you till you have paid the last penny that you\r\nowe. Then I shall know that you are a man.”\r\n\r\nShe did not look back. I watched her, till the sunlight, streaming in my\r\neyes, raised a golden mist between us.\r\n\r\nThen I went to my work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCESS OF THE GOLDEN LOCKS SENDS PAUL A RING.\r\n\r\nIt took me three years to win that handshake. For the first six months I\r\nremained in Deptford. There was excellent material to be found there\r\nfor humorous articles, essays, stories; likewise for stories tragic\r\nand pathetic. But I owed a hundred and fifty pounds--a little over\r\ntwo hundred it reached to, I found, when I came to add up the actual\r\nfigures. So I paid strict attention to business, left the tears to be\r\ngarnered by others--better fitted maybe for the task; kept to my own\r\npatch, reaped and took to market only the laughter.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning I sent each manuscript to Norah; she had it copied out,\r\ndebited me with the cost received payment, and sent me the balance. At\r\nfirst my earnings were small; but Norah was an excellent agent; rapidly\r\nthey increased. Dan grew quite cross with her, wrote in pained surprise\r\nat her greed. The “matter” was fair, but in no way remarkable. Any\r\nfriend of hers, of course, he was anxious to assist; but business was\r\nbusiness. In justice to his proprietors, he could not and would not pay\r\nmore than the market value. Miss Deleglise, replying curtly in the third\r\nperson, found herself in perfect accord with Mr. Brian as to business\r\nbeing business. If Mr. Brian could not afford to pay her price for\r\nmaterial so excellent, other editors with whom Miss Deleglise was\r\nequally well acquainted could and would. Answer by return would greatly\r\noblige, pending which the manuscript then in her hands she retained. Mr.\r\nBrian, understanding he had found his match, grumbled but paid. Whether\r\nhe had any suspicion who “Jack Homer” might be, he never confessed; but\r\nhe would have played the game, pulled his end of the rope, in either\r\ncase. Nor was he allowed to decide the question for himself. Competition\r\nwas introduced into the argument. Of purpose a certain proportion of\r\nmy work my agent sent elsewhere. “Jack Homer” grew to be a commodity\r\nin demand. For, seated at my rickety table, I laughed as I wrote, the\r\nfourth wall of the dismal room fading before my eyes revealing vistas\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nStill, it was slow work. Humour is not an industrious maid; declines to\r\nbe bustled, will work only when she feels inclined--does not often feel\r\ninclined; gives herself a good many unnecessary airs; if worried, packs\r\nup and goes off, Heaven knows where! comes back when she thinks she\r\nwill: a somewhat unreliable young person. To my literary labours I found\r\nit necessary to add journalism. I lacked Dan's magnificent assurance.\r\nFate never befriends the nervous. Had I burst into the editorial\r\nsanctum, the editor most surely would have been out; if in, would have\r\nbeen a man of short ways, would have seen to it that I went out quickly.\r\nBut the idea was not to be thought of; Robert Macaire himself in my one\r\ncoat would have been diffident, apologetic. I joined the ranks of the\r\npenny-a-liners--to be literally exact, three halfpence a liners. In\r\ncompany with half a dozen other shabby outsiders--some of them young men\r\nlike myself seeking to climb; others, older men who had sunk--I attended\r\ninquests, police courts; flew after fire engines; rejoiced in street\r\naccidents; yearned for murders. Somewhat vulture-like we lived\r\nprecariously upon the misfortunes of others. We made occasional half\r\ncrowns by providing the public with scandal, occasional crowns by\r\nkeeping our information to ourselves.\r\n\r\n“I think, gentlemen,” would explain our spokesman in a hoarse whisper,\r\non returning to the table, “I think the corpse's brother-in-law is\r\nanxious that the affair, if possible, should be kept out of the papers.”\r\n\r\nThe closeness and attention with which we would follow that particular\r\ncase, the fulness and completeness of our notes, would be quite\r\nremarkable. Our spokesman would rise, drift carelessly away, to return\r\nfive minutes later, wiping his mouth.\r\n\r\n“Not a very interesting case, gentlemen, I don't think. Shall we say\r\nfive shillings apiece?” Sometimes a sense of the dignity of our calling\r\nwould induce us to stand out for ten.\r\n\r\nAnd here also my sense of humour came to my aid; gave me perhaps an\r\nundue advantage over my competitors. Twelve good men and true had been\r\nasked to say how a Lascar sailor had met his death. It was perfectly\r\nclear how he had met his death. A plumber, working on the roof of a\r\nsmall two-storeyed house, had slipped and fallen on him. The plumber had\r\nescaped with a few bruises; the unfortunate sailor had been picked\r\nup dead. Some blame attached to the plumber. His mate, an excellent\r\nwitness, told us the whole story.\r\n\r\n“I was fixing a gas-pipe on the first floor,” said the man. “The\r\nprisoner was on the roof.”\r\n\r\n“We won't call him 'the prisoner,'” interrupted the coroner, “at least,\r\nnot yet. Refer to him, if you please, as the 'last witness.'”\r\n\r\n“The last witness,” corrected himself the man. “He shouts down the\r\nchimney to", ". His mate, an excellent\r\nwitness, told us the whole story.\r\n\r\n“I was fixing a gas-pipe on the first floor,” said the man. “The\r\nprisoner was on the roof.”\r\n\r\n“We won't call him 'the prisoner,'” interrupted the coroner, “at least,\r\nnot yet. Refer to him, if you please, as the 'last witness.'”\r\n\r\n“The last witness,” corrected himself the man. “He shouts down the\r\nchimney to know if I was ready for him.”\r\n\r\n“'Ready and waiting,' I says.\r\n\r\n“'Right,' he says; 'I'm coming in through the window.'\r\n\r\n“'Wait a bit,' I says; 'I'll go down and move the ladder for you.\r\n\r\n“'It's all right,' he says; 'I can reach it.'\r\n\r\n“'No, you can't,' I says. 'It's the other side of the chimney.'\r\n\r\n“'I can get round,' he says.\r\n\r\n“Well, before I knew what had happened, I hears him go, smack! I rushes\r\nto the window and looks out: I see him on the pavement, sitting up like.\r\n\r\n“'Hullo, Jim,' I says. 'Have you hurt yourself?'\r\n\r\n“'I think I'm all right,' he says, 'as far as I can tell. But I wish\r\nyou'd come down. This bloke I've fallen on looks a bit sick.'”\r\n\r\nThe others headed their flimsy “Sad Accident,” a title truthful but not\r\nalluring. I altered mine to “Plumber in a Hurry--Fatal Result.” Saying\r\nas little as possible about the unfortunate sailor, I called the\r\nattention of plumbers generally to the coroner's very just remarks upon\r\nthe folly of undue haste; pointed out to them, as a body, the trouble\r\nthat would arise if somehow they could not cure themselves of this\r\ntendency to rush through their work without a moment's loss of time.\r\n\r\nIt established for me a useful reputation. The sub-editor of one evening\r\npaper condescended so far as to come out in his shirt-sleeves and shake\r\nhands with me.\r\n\r\n“That's the sort of thing we want,” he told me; “a light touch, a bit of\r\nhumour.”\r\n\r\nI snatched fun from fires (I sincerely trust the insurance premiums were\r\nnot overdue); culled quaintness from street rows; extracted merriment\r\nfrom catastrophes the most painful, and prospered.\r\n\r\nThough often within a stone's throw of the street, I unremittingly\r\navoided the old house at Poplar. I was suffering inconvenience at this\r\nperiod by reason of finding myself two distinct individuals, contending\r\nwith each other. My object was to encourage the new Paul--the sensible,\r\npractical, pushful Paul, whose career began to look promising; to\r\ndrive away from interfering with me his strangely unlike twin--the old\r\nchildish Paul of the sad, far-seeing eyes. Sometimes out of the cracked\r\nlooking-glass his wistful, yearning face would plead to me; but I would\r\nsternly shake my head. I knew well his cunning. Had I let him have his\r\nway, he would have led me through the maze of streets he knew so well,\r\npast the broken railings (outside which he would have left my body\r\nstanding), along the weedy pathway, through the cracked and dented door,\r\nup the creaking staircase to the dismal little chamber where we once--he\r\nand I together--had sat dreaming foolish dreams.\r\n\r\n“Come,” he would whisper; “it is so near. Let us push aside the chest\r\nof drawers very quietly, softly raise the broken sash, prop it open with\r\nthe Latin dictionary, lean our elbows on the sill, listen to the voices\r\nof the weary city, voices calling to us from the darkness.”\r\n\r\nBut I was too wary to be caught. “Later on,” I would reply to him; “when\r\nI have made my way, when I am stronger to withstand your wheedling. Then\r\nI will go with you, if you are still in existence, my sentimental little\r\nfriend. We will dream again the old impractical, foolish dreams--and\r\nlaugh at them.”\r\n\r\nSo he would fade away, and in his place would nod to me approvingly a\r\nbusinesslike-looking, wide-awake young fellow.\r\n\r\nBut to one sentimental temptation I succumbed. My position was by\r\nnow assured; there was no longer any reason for my hiding myself. I\r\ndetermined to move westward. I had not intended to soar so high, but\r\npassing through Guildford Street one day, the creeper-covered corner\r\nhouse that my father had once thought of taking recalled itself to me.\r\nA card was in the fanlight. I knocked and made enquiries. A\r\nbed-sitting-room upon the third floor was vacant. I remembered it well\r\nthe moment the loquacious landlady opened its door.\r\n\r\n“This shall be your room, Paul,” said my father. So clearly his voice\r\nsounded behind me that I turned, forgetting for the moment it was but\r\na memory. “You will be quiet here, and we can shut out the bed and\r\nwashstand with a screen.”\r\n\r\nSo my father had his way. It was a pleasant, sunny little room,\r\noverlooking the gardens of the hospital. I followed my father's\r\nsuggestion, shut out the bed and washstand with a screen. And sometimes\r\nof an evening it would amuse me to hear my father turn the handle of the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n“How are you getting on--all right?”\r\n\r\n“Famously.”\r\n\r\nOften there came back to me the words he had once used. “You must be the\r\npractical man, Paul, and get on. Myself, I have always been somewhat of\r\na dreamer. I meant to do such great things in the world, and somehow I\r\nsuppose I aimed too high. I wasn't--practical.”\r\n\r\n“But ought not one to aim high?” I had asked.\r\n\r\nMy father had fidgeted in his chair. “It is very difficult to say. It\r\nis all so--so very ununderstandable. You aim high and you don't hit\r\nanything--at least, it seems as if you didn't. Perhaps, after all, it\r\nis better to aim at something low, and--and hit it. Yet it seems a\r\npity--one's ideals, all the best part of one--I don't know why it is.\r\nPerhaps we do not understand.”\r\n\r\nFor some months I had been writing over my own name. One day a letter\r\nwas forwarded to me by an editor to whose care it had been addressed. It\r\nwas a short, formal note from the maternal Sellars, inviting me to\r\nthe wedding of her daughter with a Mr. Reginald Clapper. I had\r\nalmost forgotten the incident of the Lady 'Ortensia, but it was not\r\nunsatisfactory to learn that it had terminated pleasantly. Also, I\r\njudged from an invitation having been sent me, that the lady wished\r\nme to be witness of the fact that my desertion had not left her\r\ndisconsolate. So much gratification I felt I owed her, and accordingly,\r\npurchasing a present as expensive as my means would permit, I made\r\nmy way on the following Thursday, clad in frock coat and light grey\r\ntrousers, to Kennington Church.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony was already in progress. Creeping on tiptoe up the aisle,\r\nI was about to slip into an empty pew, when a hand was laid upon my\r\nsleeve.\r\n\r\n“We're all here,” whispered the O'Kelly; “just room for ye.”\r\n\r\nSqueezing his hand as I passed, I sat down between the Signora and Mrs.\r\nPeedles. Both ladies were weeping; the Signora silently, one tear at a\r\ntime clinging fondly to her pretty face as though loath to fall from\r\nit; Mrs. Peedles copiously, with explosive gurgles, as of water from a\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\n“It is such a beautiful service,” murmured the Signora, pressing my hand\r\nas I settled myself down. “I should so--so love to be married.”\r\n\r\n“Me darling,” whispered the O'Kelly, seizing her other hand and kissing\r\nit covertly behind his open Prayer Book, “perhaps ye will be--one day.”\r\n\r\nThe Signora through her tears smiled at him, but with a sigh shook her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pe", " water from a\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\n“It is such a beautiful service,” murmured the Signora, pressing my hand\r\nas I settled myself down. “I should so--so love to be married.”\r\n\r\n“Me darling,” whispered the O'Kelly, seizing her other hand and kissing\r\nit covertly behind his open Prayer Book, “perhaps ye will be--one day.”\r\n\r\nThe Signora through her tears smiled at him, but with a sigh shook her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peedles, clad, so far as the dim November light enabled me to\r\njudge, in the costume of Queen Elizabeth--nothing regal; the sort of\r\nthing one might assume to have been Her Majesty's second best, say third\r\nbest, frock--explained that weddings always reminded her how fleeting a\r\nthing was love.\r\n\r\n“The poor dears!” she sobbed. “But there, there's no telling. Perhaps\r\nthey'll be happy. I'm sure I hope they may be. He looks harmless.”\r\n\r\nJarman, stretching out a hand to me from the other side of Mrs. Peedles,\r\nurged me to cheer up. “Don't wear your 'eart upon your sleeve,” he\r\nadvised. “Try and smile.”\r\n\r\nIn the vestry I met old friends. The maternal Sellars, stouter than\r\never, had been accommodated with a chair--at least, I assumed so, she\r\nbeing in a sitting posture; the chair itself was not in evidence. She\r\ngreeted me with more graciousness than I had expected, enquiring after\r\nmy health with pointedness and an amount of tender solicitude that,\r\nuntil the explanation broke upon me, somewhat puzzled me.\r\n\r\nMr. Reginald Clapper was a small but energetic gentleman, much\r\nimpressed, I was glad to notice, with a conviction of his own good\r\nfortune. He expressed the greatest delight at being introduced to me,\r\nshook me heartily by the hand, and hoped we should always be friends.\r\n\r\n“Won't be my fault if we're not,” he added. “Come and see us whenever\r\nyou like.” He repeated this three times. I gathered the general\r\nsentiment to be that he was acting, if anything, with excess of\r\ngenerosity.\r\n\r\nMrs. Reginald Clapper, as I was relieved to know she now was, received\r\nmy salute to a subdued murmur of applause. She looked to my eyes\r\nhandsomer than when I had last seen her, or maybe my taste was growing\r\nless exacting. She also trusted she might always regard me as a friend.\r\nI replied that it would be my hope to deserve the honour; whereupon she\r\nkissed me of her own accord, and embracing her mother, shed some tears,\r\nexplaining the reason to be that everybody was so good to her.\r\n\r\nBrother George, less lank than formerly, hampered by a pair of enormous\r\nwhite kid gloves, superintended my signing of the register, whispering\r\nto me sympathetically: “Better luck next time, old cock.”\r\n\r\nThe fat young lady--or, maybe, the lean young lady, grown stouter,\r\nI cannot say for certain--who feared I had forgotten her, a thing I\r\nassured her utterly impossible, was good enough to say that, in her\r\nopinion, I was worth all the others put together.\r\n\r\n“And so I told her,” added the fat young lady--or the lean one grown\r\nstouter, “a dozen times if I told her once. But there!”\r\n\r\nI murmured my obligations.\r\n\r\nCousin Joseph, 'whom I found no difficulty in recognising by reason of\r\nhis watery eyes, appeared not so chirpy as of yore.\r\n\r\n“You take my tip,” advised Cousin Joseph, drawing me aside, “and keep\r\nout of it.”\r\n\r\n“You speak from experience?” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“I'm as fond of a joke,” said the watery-eyed Joseph, “as any man. But\r\nwhen it comes to buckets of water--”\r\n\r\nA reminder from the maternal Sellars that breakfast had been ordered\r\nfor eleven o'clock caused a general movement and arrested Joseph's\r\nrevelations.\r\n\r\n“See you again, perhaps,” he murmured, and pushed past me.\r\n\r\nWhat Mrs. Sellars, I suppose, would have alluded to as a cold\r\ncol-la-shon had been arranged for at a restaurant near by. I walked\r\nthere in company with Uncle and Aunt Gutton; not because I particularly\r\ndesired their companionship, but because Uncle Gutton, seizing me by the\r\narm, left me no alternative.\r\n\r\n“Now then, young man,” commenced Uncle Gutton kindly, but boisterously\r\nso soon as we were in the street, at some little distance behind the\r\nothers, “if you want to pitch into me, you pitch away. I shan't mind,\r\nand maybe it'll do you good.”\r\n\r\nI informed him that nothing was further from my desire.\r\n\r\n“Oh, all right,” returned Uncle Gutton, seemingly disappointed. “If\r\nyou're willing to forgive and forget, so am I. I never liked you, as\r\nI daresay you saw, and so I told Rosie. 'He may be cleverer than he\r\nlooks,' I says, 'or he may be a bigger fool than I think him, though\r\nthat's hardly likely. You take my advice and get a full-grown article,\r\nthen you'll know what you're doing.'”\r\n\r\nI told him I thought his advice had been admirable.\r\n\r\n“I'm glad you think so,” he returned, somewhat puzzled; “though if you\r\nwanted to call me names I shouldn't have blamed you. Anyhow, you've took\r\nit like a sensible chap. You've got over it, as I always told her you\r\nwould. Young men out of story-books don't die of broken hearts, even\r\nif for a month or two they do feel like standing on their head in the\r\nwater-butt.”\r\n\r\n“Why, I was in love myself three times,” explained Uncle Gutton, “before\r\nI married the old woman.”\r\n\r\nAunt Gutton sighed and said she was afraid gentlemen didn't feel these\r\nthings as much as they ought to.\r\n\r\n“They've got their living to earn,” retorted Uncle Gutton.\r\n\r\nI agreed with Uncle Gutton that life could not be wasted in vain regret.\r\n\r\n“As for the rest,” admitted Uncle Gutton, handsomely, “I was wrong.\r\nYou've turned out better than I expected you would.”\r\n\r\nI thanked him for his improved opinion, and as we entered the restaurant\r\nwe shook hands.\r\n\r\nMinikin we found there waiting for us. He explained that having been\r\nable to obtain only limited leave of absence from business, he had\r\nconcluded the time would be better employed at the restaurant than at\r\nthe church. Others were there also with whom I was unacquainted, young\r\nsparks, admirers, I presume, of the Lady 'Ortensia in her professional\r\ncapacity, fellow-clerks of Mr. Clapper, who was something in the City.\r\nAltogether we must have numbered a score.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was laid in a large room on the first floor. The wedding\r\npresents stood displayed upon a side-table. My own, with my card\r\nattached, had not been seen by Mrs. Clapper till that moment. She and\r\nher mother lingered, examining it.\r\n\r\n“Real silver!” I heard the maternal Sellars whisper, “Must have paid a\r\nten pound note for it.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you'll find it useful,” I said.\r\n\r\nThe maternal Sellars, drifting away, joined the others gathered together\r\nat the opposite end of the room.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you think I set my cap at you merely because you were a\r\ngentleman,” said the Lady 'Ortensia.\r\n\r\n“Don't let's talk about it,” I answered. “We were both foolish.”\r\n\r\n“I don't want you to think it was merely that,” continued the Lady\r\n'Ortensia. “I did like you. And I wouldn't have disgraced you--at least,\r\nI'd have tried not to. We women are quick to learn. You never gave me\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“Believe me, things are much better as they are,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I suppose so,” she answered. “I was a fool.” She glanced round; we\r\nstill had the corner to ourselves. “I told a rare pack of lies,” she\r\nsaid; “I didn't seem able to help it; I was feeling sore all over. But\r\nI have always been ashamed of myself. I'll tell them the truth, if", " learn. You never gave me\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“Believe me, things are much better as they are,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I suppose so,” she answered. “I was a fool.” She glanced round; we\r\nstill had the corner to ourselves. “I told a rare pack of lies,” she\r\nsaid; “I didn't seem able to help it; I was feeling sore all over. But\r\nI have always been ashamed of myself. I'll tell them the truth, if you\r\nlike.”\r\n\r\nI thought I saw a way of making her mind easy. “My dear girl,” I said,\r\n“you have taken the blame upon yourself, and let me go scot-free. It was\r\ngenerous of you.”\r\n\r\n“You mean that?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“The truth,” I answered, “would shift all the shame on to me. It was I\r\nwho broke my word, acted shabbily from beginning to end.”\r\n\r\n“I hadn't looked at it in that light,” she replied. “Very well, I'll\r\nhold my tongue.”\r\n\r\nMy place at breakfast was to the left of the maternal Sellars, the\r\nSignora next to me, and the O'Kelly opposite. Uncle Gutton faced the\r\nbride and bridegroom. The disillusioned Joseph was hidden from me by\r\nflowers, so that his voice, raised from time to time, fell upon my ears,\r\nembellished with the mysterious significance of the unseen oracle.\r\n\r\nFor the first quarter of an hour or so the meal proceeded almost in\r\nsilence. The maternal Sellars when not engaged in whispered argument\r\nwith the perspiring waiter, was furtively occupied in working sums upon\r\nthe table-cloth by aid of a blunt pencil. The Signora, strangely unlike\r\nher usual self, was not in talkative mood.\r\n\r\n“It was so kind of them to invite me,” said the Signora, speaking low.\r\n“But I feel I ought not to have come.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” I asked\r\n\r\n“I'm not fit to be here,” murmured the Signora in a broken voice. “What\r\nright have I at wedding breakfasts? Of course, for dear Willie it is\r\ndifferent. He has been married.”\r\n\r\nThe O'Kelly, who never when the Signora was present seemed to care much\r\nfor conversation in which she was unable to participate, took advantage\r\nof his neighbour's being somewhat deaf to lapse into abstraction. Jarman\r\nessayed a few witticisms of a general character, of which nobody took\r\nany notice. The professional admirers of the Lady 'Ortensia, seated\r\ntogether at a corner of the table, appeared to be enjoying a small\r\njoke among themselves. Occasionally, one or another of them would laugh\r\nnervously. But for the most part the only sounds to be heard were the\r\nclatter of the knives and forks, the energetic shuffling of the waiter,\r\nand a curious hissing noise as of escaping gas, caused by Uncle Gutton\r\ndrinking champagne.\r\n\r\nWith the cutting, or, rather, the smashing into a hundred fragments,\r\nof the wedding cake--a work that taxed the united strength of bride\r\nand bridegroom to the utmost--the atmosphere lost something of its\r\nsombreness. The company, warmed by food, displaying indications of being\r\nnearly done, commenced to simmer. The maternal Sellars, putting away\r\nwith her blunt pencil considerations of material nature, embraced the\r\ntable with a smile.\r\n\r\n“But it is a sad thing,” sighed the maternal Sellars the next moment,\r\nwith a shake of her huge head, “when your daughter marries, and goes\r\naway and leaves you.”\r\n\r\n“Damned sight sadder,” commented Uncle Gutton, “when she don't go off,\r\nbut hangs on at home year after year and expects you to keep her.”\r\n\r\nI credit Uncle Gutton with intending this as an aside for the exclusive\r\nbenefit of the maternal Sellars; but his voice was not of the timbre\r\nthat lends itself to secrecy. One of the bridesmaids, a plain, elderly\r\ngirl, bending over her plate, flushed scarlet. I concluded her to be\r\nMiss Gutton.\r\n\r\n“It doesn't seem to me,” said Aunt Gutton from the other end of the\r\ntable, “that gentlemen are as keen on marrying nowadays as they used to\r\nbe.”\r\n\r\n“Got to know a bit about it, I expect,” sounded the small, shrill voice\r\nof the unseen Joseph.\r\n\r\n“To my thinking,” exclaimed a hatchet-faced gentleman, “one of the evils\r\ncrying most loudly for redress at the present moment is the utterly\r\nneedless and monstrous expense of legal proceedings.” He spoke rapidly\r\nand with warmth. “Take divorce. At present, what is it? The rich man's\r\nluxury.”\r\n\r\nConversation appeared to be drifting in a direction unsuitable to the\r\noccasion; but Jarman was fortunately there to seize the helm.\r\n\r\n“The plain fact of the matter is,” said Jarman, “girls have gone up in\r\nvalue. Time was, so I've heard, when they used to be given away with\r\na useful bit of household linen, maybe a chair or two. Nowadays--well,\r\nit's only chaps wallowing in wealth like Clapper there as can afford a\r\nreally first-class article.”\r\n\r\nMr. Clapper, not a gentleman in other respects of exceptional\r\nbrilliancy, possessed one quality that popularity-seekers might have\r\nenvied him: the ability to explode on the slightest provocation into a\r\nlaugh instinct with all the characteristics of genuine delight.\r\n\r\n“Give and take,” observed the maternal Sellars, so soon as Mr. Clapper's\r\nroar had died away; “that's what you've got to do when you're married.”\r\n\r\n“Give a deal more than you bargained for and take what you don't\r\nwant--that sums it up,” came the bitter voice of the unseen.\r\n\r\n“Oh, do be quiet, Joe,” advised the stout young lady, from which I\r\nconcluded she had once been the lean young lady. “You talk enough for a\r\nman.”\r\n\r\n“Can't I open my mouth?” demanded the indignant oracle.\r\n\r\n“You look less foolish when you keep it shut,” returned the stout young\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n“We'll show them how to get on,” observed the Lady 'Ortensia to her\r\nbridegroom, with a smile.\r\n\r\nMr. Clapper responded with a gurgle.\r\n\r\n“When me and the old girl there fixed things up,” said Uncle Gutton, “we\r\ndidn't talk no nonsense, and we didn't start with no misunderstandings.\r\n'I'm not a duke,' I says--”\r\n\r\n“Had she been mistaking you for one?” enquired Minikin.\r\n\r\nMr. Clapper commented, not tactfully, but with appreciative laugh. I\r\nfeared for a moment lest Uncle Gutton's little eyes should leave his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“Not being a natural-born, one-eyed fool,” replied Uncle Gutton, glaring\r\nat the unabashed Minikin, “she did not. 'I'm not a duke,' I says, and\r\n_she_ had sense enough to know as I was talking sarcastic like. 'I'm not\r\noffering you a life of luxury and ease. I'm offering you myself, just\r\nwhat you see, and nothing more.'\r\n\r\n“She took it?” asked Minikin, who was mopping up his gravy with his\r\nbread.\r\n\r\n“She accepted me, sir,” returned Uncle Gutton, in a voice that would\r\nhave awed any one but Minikin. “Can you give me any good reason for her\r\nnot doing so?”\r\n\r\n“No need to get mad with me,” explained Minikin. “I'm not blaming the\r\npoor woman. We all have our moments of despair.”\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Clapper again exploded. Uncle Gutton rose to his feet.\r\nThe ready Jarman saved the situation.\r\n\r\n“'Ear! 'ear!” cried Jarman, banging the table with the handles of two\r\nknives. “Silence for Uncle Gutton! 'E's going to propose a toast. 'Ear,\r\n'ear!”\r\n\r\nMrs. Clapper, seconding his efforts, the whole table broke into\r\napplause.\r\n\r\n“What, as a matter of fact, I did get up to say--” began Uncle Gutton.\r\n\r\n“Good old Uncle Gutton!” persisted the determined Jarman. “Bride and\r\nbridegroom--long life to 'em!”\r\n\r\nUncle Sutton, evidently pleased, allowed his indignation against Minikin\r\nto evaporate.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Uncle Gutton, “if you think I'm", "apper, seconding his efforts, the whole table broke into\r\napplause.\r\n\r\n“What, as a matter of fact, I did get up to say--” began Uncle Gutton.\r\n\r\n“Good old Uncle Gutton!” persisted the determined Jarman. “Bride and\r\nbridegroom--long life to 'em!”\r\n\r\nUncle Sutton, evidently pleased, allowed his indignation against Minikin\r\nto evaporate.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Uncle Gutton, “if you think I'm the one to do it--”\r\n\r\nThe response was unmistakable. In our enthusiasm we broke two glasses\r\nand upset a cruet; a small, thin lady was unfortunate enough to shed her\r\nchignon. Thus encouraged, Uncle Sutton launched himself upon his task.\r\nPersonally, I should have been better pleased had Fate not interposed to\r\nassign to him the duty.\r\n\r\nStarting with a somewhat uninstructive history of his own career, he\r\nsuddenly, and for no reason at all obvious, branched off into fierce\r\ncensure of the Adulteration Act. Reminded of the time by the maternal\r\nSellars, he got in his first sensible remark by observing that with\r\nsuch questions, he took it, the present company was not particularly\r\ninterested, and directed himself to the main argument. To his, Uncle\r\nGutton's, foresight, wisdom and instinctive understanding of humanity,\r\nMr. Clapper, it appeared, owed his present happiness. Uncle Gutton it\r\nwas who had divined from the outset the sort of husband the fair\r\nRosina would come eventually to desire--a plain, simple, hard-working,\r\nlevel-headed sort of chap, with no hity-tity nonsense about him: such\r\nan one, in short, as Mr. Clapper himself--(at this Mr. Clapper expressed\r\napproval by a lengthy laugh)--a gentleman who, so far as Uncle Gutton's\r\nknowledge went, had but one fault: a silly habit of laughing when there\r\nwas nothing whatever to laugh at; of which, it was to be hoped, the\r\ncares and responsibilities of married life would cure him. (To the\r\nrest of the discourse Mr. Clapper listened with a gravity painfully\r\nmaintained.) There had been moments, Uncle Gutton was compelled to\r\nadmit, when the fair Rosina had shown inclination to make a fool of\r\nherself--to desire in place of honest worth mere painted baubles. He\r\nused the term in no offensive sense. Speaking for himself, what a man\r\nwanted beyond his weekly newspaper, he, Uncle Gutton, was unable to\r\nunderstand; but if there were fools in the world who wanted to read\r\nrubbish written by other fools, then the other fools would of course\r\nwrite it; Uncle Gutton did not blame them. He mentioned no names, but\r\nwhat he would say was: a plain man for a sensible girl, and no painted\r\nbaubles.\r\n\r\nThe waiter here entering with a message from the cabman to the effect\r\nthat if he was to catch the twelve-forty-five from Charing Cross, it\r\nwas about full time he started, Uncle Gutton was compelled to bring his\r\nspeech to a premature conclusion. The bride and bridegroom were hustled\r\ninto their clothes. There followed much female embracing and male\r\nhand-shaking. The rice having been forgotten, the waiter was almost\r\nthrown downstairs, with directions to at once procure some. There\r\nappearing danger of his not returning in time, the resourceful Jarman\r\nsuggested cold semolina pudding as a substitute. But the idea was\r\ndiscouraged by the bride. A slipper of remarkable antiquity, discovered\r\non the floor and regarded as a gift from Providence, was flung from the\r\nwindow by brother George, with admirable aim, and alighted on the roof\r\nof the cab. The waiter, on his return, not being able to find it, seemed\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\n\r\nI walked back as far as the Obelisk with the O'Kelly and the Signora,\r\nwho were then living together in Lambeth. Till that morning I had\r\nnot seen the O'Kelly since my departure from London, nearly two years\r\nbefore, so that we had much to tell each other. For the third time now\r\nhad the O'Kelly proved his utter unworthiness to be the husband of the\r\nlady to whom he still referred as his “dear good wife.”\r\n\r\n“But, under the circumstances, would it not be better,” I suggested,\r\n“for her to obtain a divorce? Then you and the Signora could marry and\r\nthere would be an end to the whole trouble.”\r\n\r\n“From a strictly worldly point of view,” replied the O'Kelly, “it\r\ncertainly would be; but Mrs. O'Kelly”--his voice took to itself\r\nunconsciously a tone of reverence--“is not an ordinary woman. You can\r\nhave no conception, my dear Kelver, of her goodness. I had a letter from\r\nher only two months ago, a few weeks after the--the last occurrence. Not\r\none word of reproach, only that if I trespassed against her even unto\r\nseven times seven she would still consider it her duty to forgive me;\r\nthat the 'home' would always be there for me to return to and repent.”\r\n\r\nA tear stood in the O'Kelly's eye. “A beautiful nature,” he commented.\r\n“There are not many women like her.”\r\n\r\n“Not one in a million!” added the Signora, with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“Well, to me it seems like pure obstinacy,” I said.\r\n\r\nThe O'Kelly spoke quite angrily. “Don't ye say a word against her! I\r\nwon't listen to it. Ye don't understand her. She never will despair of\r\nreforming me.”\r\n\r\n“You see, Mr. Kelver,” explained the Signora, “the whole difficulty\r\narises from my unfortunate profession. It is impossible for me to keep\r\nout of dear Willie's way. If I could earn my living by any other means,\r\nI would; but I can't. And when he sees my name upon the posters, it's\r\nall over with him.”\r\n\r\n“I do wish, Willie, dear,” added the Signora in tones of gentle reproof,\r\n“that you were not quite so weak.”\r\n\r\n“Me dear,” replied the O'Kelly, “ye don't know how attractive ye are or\r\nye wouldn't blame me.”\r\n\r\nI laughed. “Why don't you be firm,” I suggested to the Signora, “send\r\nhim packing about his business?”\r\n\r\n“I ought to,” admitted the Signora. “I always mean to, until I see him.\r\nThen I don't seem able to say anything--not anything I ought to.”\r\n\r\n“Ye do say it,” contradicted the O'Kelly. “Ye're an angel, only I won't\r\nlisten to ye.”\r\n\r\n“I don't say it as if I meant it,” persisted the Signora. “It's evident\r\nI don't.”\r\n\r\n“I still think it a pity,” I said, “someone does not explain to Mrs.\r\nO'Kelly that a divorce would be the truer kindness.”\r\n\r\n“It is difficult to decide,” argued the Signora. “If ever you should\r\nwant to leave me--”\r\n\r\n“Me darling!” exclaimed the O'Kelly.\r\n\r\n“But you may,” insisted the Signora. “Something may happen to help you,\r\nto show you how wicked it all is. I shall be glad then to think that you\r\nwill go back to her. Because she is a good woman, Willie, you know she\r\nis.”\r\n\r\n“She's a saint,” agreed Willie.\r\n\r\nAt the Obelisk I shook hands with them, and alone pursued my way towards\r\nFleet Street.\r\n\r\nThe next friend whose acquaintance I renewed was Dan. He occupied\r\nchambers in the Temple, and one evening a week or two after the\r\n'Ortensia marriage, I called upon him. Nothing in his manner of greeting\r\nme suggested the necessity of explanation. Dan never demanded anything\r\nof his friends beyond their need of him. Shaking hands with me, he\r\npushed me down into the easy-chair, and standing with his back to the\r\nfire, filled and lighted his pipe.\r\n\r\n“I left you alone,” he said. “You had to go through it, your slough of\r\ndespond. It lies across every path--that leads to anywhere. Clear of\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“I think so,” I replied, smiling.\r\n\r\n“You are on the high road,” he continued. “You have only to walk\r\nsteadily. Sure you have left nothing", "ed me down into the easy-chair, and standing with his back to the\r\nfire, filled and lighted his pipe.\r\n\r\n“I left you alone,” he said. “You had to go through it, your slough of\r\ndespond. It lies across every path--that leads to anywhere. Clear of\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“I think so,” I replied, smiling.\r\n\r\n“You are on the high road,” he continued. “You have only to walk\r\nsteadily. Sure you have left nothing behind you--in the slough?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing worth bringing out of it,” I said. “Why do you ask so\r\nseriously?”\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand upon my head, rumpling my hair, as in the old days.\r\n\r\n“Don't leave him behind you,” he said; “the little boy Paul--Paul the\r\ndreamer.”\r\n\r\nI laughed. “Oh, he! He was only in my way.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, here,” answered Dan. “This is not his world. He is of no use to\r\nyou here; won't help you to bread and cheese--no, nor kisses either. But\r\nkeep him near you. Later, you will find, perhaps, that all along he has\r\nbeen the real Paul--the living, growing Paul; the other--the active,\r\nworldly, pushful Paul, only the stuff that dreams are made of, his\r\nfretful life a troubled night rounded by a sleep.”\r\n\r\n“I have been driving him away,” I said. “He is so--so impracticable.”\r\n\r\nDan shook his head gravely. “It is not his world,” he repeated. “We must\r\neat, drink--be husbands, fathers. He does not understand. Here he is the\r\nchild. Take care of him.”\r\n\r\nWe sat in silence for a little while--for longer, perhaps, than it\r\nseemed to us--Dan in the chair opposite to me, each of us occupied with\r\nhis own thoughts.\r\n\r\n“You have an excellent agent,” said Dan; “retain her services as long as\r\nyou can. She possesses the great advantage of having no conscience, as\r\nregards your affairs. Women never have where they--”\r\n\r\nHe broke off to stir the fire.\r\n\r\n“You like her?” I asked. The words sounded feeble. It is only the writer\r\nwho fits the language to the emotion; the living man more often selects\r\nby contrast.\r\n\r\n“She is my ideal woman,” returned Dan; “true and strong and tender;\r\nclear as crystal, pure as dawn. Like her!”\r\n\r\nHe knocked the ashes from his pipe. “We do not marry our ideals,” he\r\nwent on. “We love with our hearts, not with our souls. The woman I shall\r\nmarry”--he sat gazing into the fire, a smile upon his face--“she will be\r\nsome sweet, clinging, childish woman, David Copperfield's Dora. Only\r\nI am not Doady, who always seems to me to have been somewhat of a--He\r\nreminds me of you, Paul, a little. Dickens was right; her helplessness,\r\nas time went on, would have bored him more and more instead of appealing\r\nto him.”\r\n\r\n“And the women,” I suggested, “do they marry their ideals?”\r\n\r\nHe laughed. “Ask them.”\r\n\r\n“The difference between men and women,” he continued, “is very slight;\r\nwe exaggerate it for purposes of art. What sort of man do you suppose he\r\nis, Norah's ideal? Can't you imagine him?--But I can tell you the type\r\nof man she will marry, ay, and love with all her heart.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me from under his strong brows drawn down, a twinkle in his\r\neye.\r\n\r\n“A nice enough fellow--clever, perhaps, but someone--well, someone who\r\nwill want looking after, taking care of, managing; someone who will\r\nappeal to the mother side of her--not her ideal man, but the man for\r\nwhom nature intended her.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps with her help,” I said, “he may in time become her ideal.”\r\n\r\n“There's a long road before him,” growled Dan.\r\n\r\nIt was Norah herself who broke to me the news of Barbara's elopement\r\nwith Hal. I had seen neither of them since my return to London. Old\r\nHasluck a month or so before I had met in the City one day by chance,\r\nand he had insisted on my lunching with him. I had found him greatly\r\nchanged. His buoyant self-assurance had deserted him; in its place a\r\nfretful eagerness had become his motive force. At first he had talked\r\nboastingly: Had I seen the _Post_ for last Monday, the _Court Circular_\r\nfor the week before? Had I read that Barbara had danced with the Crown\r\nPrince, that the Count and Countess Huescar had been entertaining a\r\nGrand Duke? What did I think of that! and such like. Was not money\r\nmaster of the world? Ay, and the nobs should be made to acknowledge it!\r\n\r\nBut as he had gulped down glass after glass the brag had died away.\r\n\r\n“No children,” he had whispered to me across the table; “that's what I\r\ncan't understand. Nearly four years and no children! What'll be the\r\ngood of it all? Where do I come in? What do I get? Damn these rotten\r\npopinjays! What do they think we buy them for?”\r\n\r\nIt was in the studio on a Monday morning that Norah told me. It was\r\nthe talk of the town for the next day--and the following eight. She had\r\nheard it the evening before at supper, and had written to me to come and\r\nsee her.\r\n\r\n“I thought you would rather hear it quietly,” said Norah, “than learn it\r\nfrom a newspaper paragraph. Besides, I wanted to tell you this. She did\r\nwrong when she married, putting aside love for position. Now she has\r\ndone right. She has put aside her shame with all the advantages she\r\nderived from it. She has proved herself a woman: I respect her.”\r\n\r\nNorah would not have said that to please me had she not really thought\r\nit. I could see it from that light; but it brought me no comfort. My\r\ngoddess had a heart, passions, was a mere human creature like myself.\r\nFrom her cold throne she had stepped down to mingle with the world. So\r\nsome youthful page of Arthur's court may have felt, learning the Great\r\nQueen was but a woman.\r\n\r\nI never spoke with her again but once. That was an evening three years\r\nlater in Brussels. Strolling idly after dinner the bright lights of a\r\ntheatre invited me to enter. It was somewhat late; the second act had\r\ncommenced. I slipped quietly into my seat, the only one vacant at the\r\nextreme end of the front row of the first range; then, looking down upon\r\nthe stage, met her eyes. A little later an attendant whispered to me\r\nthat Madame G---- would like to see me; so at the fall of the curtain I\r\nwent round. Two men were in the dressing-room smoking, and on the table\r\nwere some bottles of champagne. She was standing before her glass, a\r\nloose shawl about her shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Excuse my shaking hands,” she said. “This damned hole is like a\r\nfurnace; I have to make up fresh after each act.”\r\n\r\nShe held them up for my inspection with a laugh; they were smeared with\r\ngrease.\r\n\r\n“D'you know my husband?” she continued. “Baron G--; Mr. Paul Kelver.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron rose. He was a red-faced, pot-bellied little man. “Delighted\r\nto meet Mr. Kelver,” he said, speaking in excellent English. “Any friend\r\nof my wife's is always a friend of mine.”\r\n\r\nHe held out his fat, perspiring hand. I was not in the mood to attach\r\nmuch importance to ceremony. I bowed and turned away, careless whether\r\nhe was offended or not.\r\n\r\n“I am glad I saw you,” she continued. “Do you remember a girl called\r\nBarbara? You and she were rather chums, years ago.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “I remember her.”\r\n\r\n“Well, she died, poor girl, three years ago.” She was rubbing paint into\r\nher cheeks as she spoke. “She asked me if ever I saw you to give you\r\nthis. I have been carrying it about with me ever since.”\r\n\r\nShe took a ring from her finger. It", " I saw you,” she continued. “Do you remember a girl called\r\nBarbara? You and she were rather chums, years ago.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “I remember her.”\r\n\r\n“Well, she died, poor girl, three years ago.” She was rubbing paint into\r\nher cheeks as she spoke. “She asked me if ever I saw you to give you\r\nthis. I have been carrying it about with me ever since.”\r\n\r\nShe took a ring from her finger. It was the one ring Barbara had worn\r\nas a girl, a chrysolite set plainly in a band of gold. I had noticed\r\nit upon her hand the first time I had seen her, sitting in my father's\r\noffice framed by the dusty books and papers. She dropped it into my\r\noutstretched palm.\r\n\r\n“Quite a pretty little romance,” laughed the Baron.\r\n\r\n“That's all,” added the woman at the glass. “She said you would\r\nunderstand.”\r\n\r\nFrom under her painted lashes she flashed a glance at me. I hope never\r\nto see again that look upon a woman's face.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” I said. “Yes, I understand. It was very kind of you. I\r\nshall always wear it.”\r\n\r\nPlacing the ring upon my finger, I left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPAUL FINDS HIS WAY.\r\n\r\nSlowly, surely, steadily I climbed, putting aside all dreams, paying\r\nstrict attention to business. Often my other self, little Paul of\r\nthe sad eyes, would seek to lure me from my work. But for my vehement\r\ndetermination never to rest for a moment till I had purchased back my\r\nhonesty, my desire--growing day by day, till it became almost a physical\r\nhunger--to feel again the pressure of Norah's strong white hand in mine,\r\nhe might possibly have succeeded. Heaven only knows what then he might\r\nhave made of me: politician, minor poet, more or less able editor,\r\nhampered by convictions--something most surely of but little service to\r\nmyself. Now and again, with a week to spare--my humour making holiday,\r\nnothing to be done but await patiently its return--I would write stories\r\nfor my own pleasure. They made no mark; but success in purposeful work\r\nis of slower growth. Had I persisted--but there was money to be earned.\r\nAnd by the time my debts were paid, I had established a reputation.\r\n\r\n“Madness!” argued practical friends. “You would be throwing away a\r\ncertain fortune for, at the best, a doubtful competence. The one you\r\nknow you can do, the other--it would be beginning your career all over\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“You would find it almost impossible now,” explained those who spoke, I\r\nknew, words of wisdom, of experience. “The world would never listen to\r\nyou. Once a humourist always a humourist. As well might a comic actor\r\ninsist upon playing Hamlet. It might be the best Hamlet ever seen upon\r\nthe stage; the audience would only laugh--or stop away.”\r\n\r\nDrawn by our mutual need of sympathy, “Goggles” and I, seeking some\r\nquiet corner in the Club, would pour out our souls to each other.\r\nHe would lay before me, at some length, his conception of Romeo--an\r\nexcellent conception, I have no doubt, though I confess it failed to\r\ninterest me. Somehow I could not picture him to myself as Romeo. But I\r\nlistened with every sign of encouragement. It was the price I paid\r\nhim for, in turn, listening to me while I unfolded to him my ideas how\r\nmonumental literature, helpful to mankind, should be imagined and built\r\nup.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps in a future existence,” laughed Goggles, one evening, rising as\r\nthe clock struck seven, “I shall be a great tragedian, and you a famous\r\npoet. Meanwhile, I suppose, as your friend Brian puts it, we are both\r\nsinning our mercies. After all, to live is the most important thing in\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\nI had strolled with him so far as the cloak-room and was helping him to\r\nget into his coat.\r\n\r\n“Take my advice”--tapping me on the chest, he fixed his funny, fishy\r\neyes upon me. Had I not known his intention to be serious, I should have\r\nlaughed, his expression was so comical. “Marry some dear little woman”\r\n (he was married himself to a placid lady of about twice his own weight);\r\n“one never understands life properly till the babies come to explain it\r\nto one.”\r\n\r\nI returned to my easy-chair before the fire. Wife, children, home!\r\nAfter all, was not that the true work of man--of the live man, not the\r\ndreamer? I saw them round me, giving to my life dignity, responsibility.\r\nThe fair, sweet woman, helper, comrade, comforter, the little faces\r\nfashioned in our image, their questioning voices teaching us the answers\r\nto life's riddles. All other hopes, ambitions, dreams, what were they?\r\nPhantoms of the morning mist fading in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nHodgson came to me one evening. “I want you to write me a comic opera,”\r\n he said. He had an open letter in his hand which he was reading. “The\r\npublic seem to be getting tired of these eternal translations from the\r\nFrench. I want something English, something new and original.”\r\n\r\n“The English is easy enough,” I replied; “but I shouldn't clamour for\r\nanything new and original if I were you.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” he asked, looking up from his letter.\r\n\r\n“You might get it,” I answered. “Then you would be disappointed.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed. “Well, you know what I mean--something we could refer to as\r\n'new and original' on the programme. What do you say? It will be a big\r\nchance for you, and I'm willing to risk it. I'm sure you can do it.\r\nPeople are beginning to talk about you.”\r\n\r\nI had written a few farces, comediettas, and they had been successful.\r\nBut the chief piece of the evening is a serious responsibility. A young\r\nman may be excused for hesitating. It can make, but also it can mar him.\r\nA comic opera above all other forms of art--if I may be forgiven\r\nfor using the sacred word in connection with such a subject--demands\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nI explained my fears. I did not explain that in my desk lay a four-act\r\ndrama throbbing with humanity, with life, with which it had been my\r\nhope--growing each day fainter--to take the theatrical public by storm,\r\nto establish myself as a serious playwright.\r\n\r\n“It's very simple,” urged Hodgson. “Provide Atherton plenty of comic\r\nbusiness; you ought to be able to do that all right. Give Gleeson\r\nsomething pretty in waltz time, and Duncan a part in which she can\r\nchange her frock every quarter of an hour or so, and the thing is done.”\r\n\r\n“I'll tell you what,” continued Hodgson, “I'll take the whole crowd\r\ndown to Richmond on Sunday. We'll have a coach, and leave the theatre at\r\nhalf-past ten. It will be an opportunity for you to study them. You'll\r\nbe able to have a talk with them and get to know just what they can do.\r\nAtherton has ideas in his head; he'll explain them to you. Then, next\r\nweek, we'll draw up a contract and set to work.”\r\n\r\nIt was too good an opportunity to let slip, though I knew that if\r\nsuccessful I should find myself pinned down firmer than ever to my role\r\nof jester. But it is remunerative, the writing of comic opera.\r\n\r\nA small crowd had gathered in the Strand to see us start.\r\n\r\n“Nothing wrong, is there?” enquired the leading lady, in a tone of some\r\nanxiety, alighting a quarter of an hour late from her cab. “It isn't a\r\nfire, is it?”\r\n\r\n“Merely assembled to see you,” explained Mr. Hodgson, without raising\r\nhis eyes from his letters.\r\n\r\n“Oh, good gracious!” cried the leading lady, “do let us get away\r\nquickly.”\r\n\r\n“Box seat, my dear,” returned Mr. Hodgson.\r\n\r\nThe leading lady, accepting the proffered assistance of myself and three\r\nother gentlemen, mounted the ladder with charming hesitation. Some delay\r\nin getting off was caused by our low", "\r\nfire, is it?”\r\n\r\n“Merely assembled to see you,” explained Mr. Hodgson, without raising\r\nhis eyes from his letters.\r\n\r\n“Oh, good gracious!” cried the leading lady, “do let us get away\r\nquickly.”\r\n\r\n“Box seat, my dear,” returned Mr. Hodgson.\r\n\r\nThe leading lady, accepting the proffered assistance of myself and three\r\nother gentlemen, mounted the ladder with charming hesitation. Some delay\r\nin getting off was caused by our low comedian, who twice, making\r\nbelieve to miss his footing, slid down again into the arms of the\r\nstolid door-keeper. The crowd, composed for the most part of small boys\r\napproving the endeavour to amuse them, laughed and applauded. Our low\r\ncomedian thus encouraged, made a third attempt upon his hands and knees,\r\nand, gaining the roof, sat down upon the tenor, who smiled somewhat\r\nmechanically.\r\n\r\nThe first dozen or so 'busses we passed our low comedian greeted by\r\nrising to his feet and bowing profoundly, afterwards falling back\r\nupon either the tenor or myself. Except by the tenor and myself his\r\nperformance appeared to be much appreciated. Charing Cross passed, and\r\nnobody seeming to be interested in our progress, to the relief of the\r\ntenor and myself, he settled down.\r\n\r\n“People sometimes ask me,” said the low comedian, brushing the dust off\r\nhis knees, “why I do this sort of thing off the stage. It amuses me.”\r\n\r\n“I was coming up to London the other day from Birmingham,” he continued.\r\n“At Willesden, when the ticket collector opened the door, I sprang out\r\nof the carriage and ran off down the platform. Of course, he ran after\r\nme, shouting to all the others to stop me. I dodged them for about\r\na minute. You wouldn't believe the excitement there was. Quite fifty\r\npeople left their seats to see what it was all about. I explained\r\nto them when they caught me that I had been travelling second with a\r\nfirst-class ticket, which was the fact. People think I do it to attract\r\nattention. I do it for my own pleasure.”\r\n\r\n“It must be a troublesome way of amusing oneself,” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“Exactly what my wife says,” he replied; “she can never understand the\r\ndesire that comes over us all, I suppose, at times, to play the fool. As\r\na rule, when she is with me I don't do it.”\r\n\r\n“She's not here today?” I asked, glancing round.\r\n\r\n“She suffers so from headaches,” he answered, “she hardly ever goes\r\nanywhere.”\r\n\r\n“I'm sorry.” I spoke not out of mere politeness; I really did feel\r\nsorry.\r\n\r\nDuring the drive to Richmond this irrepressible desire to amuse himself\r\ngot the better of him more than once or twice. Through Kensington he\r\nattracted a certain amount of attention by balancing the horn upon his\r\nnose. At Kew he stopped the coach to request of a young ladies' boarding\r\nschool change for sixpence. At the foot of Richmond Hill he caused a\r\ncrowd to assemble while trying to persuade a deaf old gentleman in a\r\nBath-chair to allow his man to race us up the hill for a shilling.\r\n\r\nAt these antics and such like our party laughed uproariously, with the\r\nexception of Hodgson, who had his correspondence to attend to, and an\r\nelegant young lady of some social standing who had lately emerged from\r\nthe Divorce Court with a reputation worth to her in cash a hundred\r\npounds a week.\r\n\r\nArriving at the hotel quarter of an hour or so before lunch time,\r\nwe strolled into the garden. Our low comedian, observing an elderly\r\ngentleman of dignified appearance sipping a glass of Vermouth at a small\r\ntable, stood for a moment rooted to the earth with astonishment, then,\r\nmaking a bee-line for the stranger, seized and shook him warmly by the\r\nhand. We exchanged admiring glances with one another.\r\n\r\n“Charlie is in good form to-day,” we told one another, and followed at\r\nhis heels.\r\n\r\nThe elderly gentleman had risen; he looked puzzled. “And how's Aunt\r\nMartha?” asked him our low comedian. “Dear old Aunt Martha! Well, I am\r\nglad! You do look bonny! How is she?”\r\n\r\n“I'm afraid--” commenced the elderly gentleman. Our low comedian started\r\nback. Other visitors had gathered round.\r\n\r\n“Don't tell me anything has happened to her! Not dead? Don't tell me\r\nthat!”\r\n\r\nHe seized the bewildered gentleman by the shoulders and presented to him\r\na face distorted by terror.\r\n\r\n“I really have not the faintest notion what you are talking about,”\r\n returned the gentleman, who seemed annoyed. “I don't know you.”\r\n\r\n“Not know me? Do you mean to tell me you've forgotten--? Isn't your name\r\nSteggles?”\r\n\r\n“No, it isn't,” returned the stranger, somewhat shortly.\r\n\r\n“My mistake,” replied our low comedian. He tossed off at one gulp what\r\nremained of the stranger's Vermouth and walked away rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe elderly gentleman, not seeing the humour of the joke, one of\r\nour party to soothe him explained to him that it was Atherton, _the_\r\nAtherton--Charlie Atherton.\r\n\r\n“Oh, is it,” growled the elderly gentleman. “Then will you tell him from\r\nme that when I want his damned tomfoolery I'll come to the theatre and\r\npay for it.”\r\n\r\n“What a disagreeable man,” we said, as, following our low comedian, we\r\nmade our way into the hotel.\r\n\r\nDuring lunch he continued in excellent spirits; kissed the bald back of\r\nthe waiter's head, pretending to mistake it for a face, called for\r\nhot mustard and water, made believe to steal the silver, and when the\r\nfinger-bowls arrived, took off his coat and requested the ladies to look\r\nthe other way.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch he became suddenly serious, and slipping his arm through\r\nmine, led me by unfrequented paths.\r\n\r\n“Now, about this new opera,” he said; “we don't want any of the old\r\nstale business. Give us something new.”\r\n\r\nI suggested that to do so might be difficult.\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” he answered. “Now, my idea is this. I am a young fellow,\r\nand I'm in love with a girl.”\r\n\r\nI promised to make a note of it.\r\n\r\n“Her father, apoplectic old idiot--make him comic: 'Damme, sir! By gad!'\r\nall that sort of thing.”\r\n\r\nBy persuading him that I understood what he meant, I rose in his\r\nestimation.\r\n\r\n“He won't have anything to say to me--thinks I'm an ass. I'm a simple\r\nsort of fellow--on the outside. But I'm not such a fool as I look.”\r\n\r\n“You don't think we are getting too much out of the groove?” I enquired.\r\n\r\nHis opinion was that the more so the better.\r\n\r\n“Very well. Then, in the second act I disguise myself. I'll come on as\r\nan organ-grinder, sing a song in broken English, then as a policeman,\r\nor a young swell about town. Give me plenty of opportunity, that's the\r\ngreat thing--opportunity to be really funny, I mean. We don't want any\r\nof the old stale tricks.”\r\n\r\nI promised him my support.\r\n\r\n“Put a little pathos in it,” he added, “give me a scene where I can show\r\nthem I've something else in me besides merely humour. We don't want to\r\nmake them howl, but just to feel a little. Let's send them out of the\r\ntheatre saying: 'Well, Charlie's often made me laugh, but I'm damned if\r\nI knew he could make me cry before!' See what I mean?”\r\n\r\nI told him I thought I did.\r\n\r\nThe leading lady, meeting us on our return, requested, with pretty tone\r\nof authority, everybody else to go away and leave us. There were cries\r\nof “Naughty!” The leading lady, laughing girlishly, took me by the hand\r\nand ran away with me.\r\n\r\n“I want to talk to you,” said the leading lady, as soon as we had\r\nreached a secluded seat overlooking the river, “about my part in the new\r\nopera. Now, can't you give me something original? Do.”\r\n\r\nHer pleading was so pretty, there was nothing for it but to pledge\r\ncompliance.\r\n\r\n“I am so tired of", "of “Naughty!” The leading lady, laughing girlishly, took me by the hand\r\nand ran away with me.\r\n\r\n“I want to talk to you,” said the leading lady, as soon as we had\r\nreached a secluded seat overlooking the river, “about my part in the new\r\nopera. Now, can't you give me something original? Do.”\r\n\r\nHer pleading was so pretty, there was nothing for it but to pledge\r\ncompliance.\r\n\r\n“I am so tired of being the simple village maiden,” said the leading\r\nlady; “what I want is a part with some opportunity in it--a coquettish\r\npart. I can flirt,” assured me the leading lady, archly. “Try me.”\r\n\r\nI satisfied her of my perfect faith.\r\n\r\n“You might,” said the leading lady, “see your way to making the plot\r\ndepend upon me. It always seems to me that the woman's part is never\r\nmade enough of in comic opera. I am sure a comic opera built round a\r\nwoman would be a really great success. Don't you agree with me, Mr.\r\nKelver,” pouted the leading lady, laying her pretty hand on mine. “We\r\nare much more interesting than the men--now, aren't we?”\r\n\r\nPersonally, as I told her, I agreed with her.\r\n\r\nThe tenor, sipping tea with me on the balcony, beckoned me aside.\r\n\r\n“About this new opera,” said the tenor; “doesn't it seem to you the\r\ntime has come to make more of the story--that the public might prefer a\r\nlittle more human interest and a little less clowning?”\r\n\r\nI admitted that a good plot was essential.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said the tenor, “that if you could write an opera\r\nround an interesting love story, you would score a success. Of course,\r\nlet there be plenty of humour, but reduce it to its proper place. As a\r\nsupport, it is excellent; when it is made the entire structure, it is\r\napt to be tiresome--at least, that is my view.”\r\n\r\nI replied with sincerity that there seemed to me much truth in what he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“Of course, so far as I am personally concerned,” went on the tenor,\r\n“it is immaterial. I draw the same salary whether I'm on the stage five\r\nminutes or an hour. But when you have a man of my position in the cast,\r\nand give him next to nothing to do--well, the public are disappointed.”\r\n\r\n“Most naturally,” I commented.\r\n\r\n“The lover,” whispered the tenor, noticing the careless approach towards\r\nus of the low comedian, “that's the character they are thinking about\r\nall the time--men and women both. It's human nature. Make your lover\r\ninteresting--that's the secret.”\r\n\r\nWaiting for the horses to be put to, I became aware of the fact that I\r\nwas standing some distance from the others in company with a tall, thin,\r\nsomewhat oldish-looking man. He spoke in low, hurried tones, fearful\r\nevidently of being overheard and interrupted.\r\n\r\n“You'll forgive me, Mr. Kelver,” he said--“Trevor, Marmaduke Trevor. I\r\nplay the Duke of Bayswater in the second act.”\r\n\r\nI was unable to recall him for the moment; there were quite a number of\r\nsmall parts in the second act. But glancing into his sensitive face, I\r\nshrank from wounding him.\r\n\r\n“A capital performance,” I lied. “It has always amused me.”\r\n\r\nHe flushed with pleasure. “I made a great success some years ago,” he\r\nsaid, “in America with a soda-water syphon, and it occurred to me that\r\nif you could, Mr. Kelver, in a natural sort of way, drop in a small part\r\nleading up to a little business with a soda-water syphon, it might help\r\nthe piece.”\r\n\r\nI wrote him his soda-water scene, I am glad to remember, and insisted\r\nupon it, in spite of a good deal of opposition. Some of the critics\r\nfound fault with the incident, as lacking in originality. But Marmaduke\r\nTrevor was quite right, it did help a little.\r\n\r\nOur return journey was an exaggerated repetition of our morning drive.\r\nOur low comedian produced hideous noises from the horn, and entered into\r\ncontests of running wit with 'bus drivers--a decided mistake from his\r\npoint of view, the score generally remaining with the 'bus driver.\r\nAt Hammersmith, seizing the opportunity of a block in the traffic,\r\nhe assumed the role of Cheap Jack, and, standing up on the back seat,\r\noffered all our hats for sale at temptingly low prices.\r\n\r\n“Got any ideas out of them?” asked Hodgson, when the time came for us to\r\nsay good-night.\r\n\r\n“I'm thinking, if you don't mind,” I answered, “of going down into the\r\ncountry and writing the piece quietly, away from everybody.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you are right,” agreed Hodgson. “Too many cooks--Be sure and\r\nhave it ready for the autumn.”\r\n\r\nI wrote it with some pleasure to myself amid the Yorkshire Wolds, and\r\nwas able to read it to the whole company assembled before the close of\r\nthe season. My turning of the last page was followed by a dead silence.\r\nThe leading lady was the first to speak. She asked if the clock upon the\r\nmantelpiece could be relied upon; because, if so, by leaving at once,\r\nshe could just catch her train. Hodgson, consulting his watch, thought,\r\nif anything, it was a little fast. The leading lady said she hoped it\r\nwas, and went. The only comforting words were spoken by the tenor. He\r\nrecalled to our mind a successful comic opera produced some years before\r\nat the Philharmonic. He distinctly remembered that up to five minutes\r\nbefore the raising of the curtain everybody had regarded it as rubbish.\r\nHe also had a train to catch. Marmaduke Trevor, with a covert shake of\r\nthe hand, urged me not to despair. The low comedian, the last to go,\r\ntold Hodgson he thought he might be able to do something with parts\r\nof it, if given a free hand. Hodgson and I left alone, looked at each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n“It's no good,” said Hodgson, “from a box-office point of view. Very\r\nclever.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know it is no good from a box-office point of view?” I\r\nventured to enquire.\r\n\r\n“I never made a mistake in my life,” replied Hodgson.\r\n\r\n“You have produced one or two failures,” I reminded him.\r\n\r\n“And shall again,” he laughed. “The right thing isn't easy to get.”\r\n\r\n“Cheer up,” he added kindly, “this is only your first attempt. We must\r\ntry and knock it into shape at rehearsal.”\r\n\r\nTheir notion of “knocking it into shape” was knocking it to pieces.\r\n\r\n“I'll tell you what we'll do,” would say the low comedian; “we'll cut\r\nthat scene out altogether.” Joyously he would draw his pencil through\r\nsome four or five pages of my manuscript.\r\n\r\n“But it is essential to the story,” I would argue.\r\n\r\n“Not at all.”\r\n\r\n“But it is. It is the scene in which Roderick escapes from prison and\r\nfalls in love with the gipsy.”\r\n\r\n“My dear boy, half-a-dozen words will do all that. I meet Roderick at\r\nthe ball. 'Hallo, what are you doing here?' 'Oh, I have escaped from\r\nprison.' 'Good business. And how's Miriam?' 'Well and happy--she is\r\ngoing to be my wife!' What more do you want?”\r\n\r\n“I have been speaking to Mr. Hodgson,” would observe the leading lady,\r\n“and he agrees with me, that if instead of falling in love with Peter, I\r\nfell in love with John--”\r\n\r\n“But John is in love with Arabella.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we've cut out Arabella. I can sing all her songs.”\r\n\r\nThe tenor would lead me into a corner. “I want you to write in a little\r\nscene for myself and Miss Duncan at the beginning of the first act. I'll\r\ntalk to her about it. I think it will be rather pretty. I want her--the\r\nsecond time I see her--to have come out of her room on to a balcony, and\r\nto be standing there bathed in moonlight.”\r\n\r\n“But the first act takes place in the early morning.”\r\n\r\n“I've thought of that. We must", " corner. “I want you to write in a little\r\nscene for myself and Miss Duncan at the beginning of the first act. I'll\r\ntalk to her about it. I think it will be rather pretty. I want her--the\r\nsecond time I see her--to have come out of her room on to a balcony, and\r\nto be standing there bathed in moonlight.”\r\n\r\n“But the first act takes place in the early morning.”\r\n\r\n“I've thought of that. We must alter it to the evening.”\r\n\r\n“But the opera opens with a hunting scene. People don't go hunting by\r\nmoonlight.”\r\n\r\n“It will be a novelty. That's what's wanted for comic opera. The\r\nordinary hunting scene! My dear boy, it has been done to death.”\r\n\r\nI stood this sort of thing for a week. “They are people of experience,”\r\n I argued to myself; “they must know more about it than I do.” By the\r\nend of the week I had arrived at the conclusion that anyhow they didn't.\r\nAdded to which I lost my temper. It is a thing I should advise any lady\r\nor gentleman thinking of entering the ranks or dramatic authorship to\r\nlose as soon as possible. I took both manuscripts with me, and, entering\r\nMr. Hodgson's private room, closed the door behind me. One parcel\r\nwas the opera as I had originally written it, a neat, intelligible\r\nmanuscript, whatever its other merits. The second, scored, interlined,\r\naltered, cut, interleaved, rewritten, reversed, turned inside out and\r\ntopsy-turvy--one long, hopeless confusion from beginning to end--was the\r\nopera, as, everybody helping, we had “knocked it into shape.”\r\n\r\n“That's your opera,” I said, pushing across to him the bulkier bundle.\r\n“If you can understand it, if you can make head or tail of it, if you\r\ncare to produce it, it is yours, and you are welcome to it. This is\r\nmine!” I laid it on the table beside the other. “It may be good, it may\r\nbe bad. If it is played at all it is played as it is written. Regard the\r\ncontract as cancelled, and make up your mind.”\r\n\r\nHe argued with force, and he argued with eloquence. He appealed to my\r\nself-interest, he appealed to my better nature. It occupied him forty\r\nminutes by the clock. Then he called me an obstinate young fool, flung\r\nthe opera as “knocked into shape” into the waste-paper basket--which\r\nwas the only proper place for it, and, striding into the middle of the\r\ncompany, gave curt directions that the damned opera was to be played as\r\nit was written, and be damned to it!\r\n\r\nThe company shrugged its shoulders, and for the next month kept them\r\nshrugged. For awhile Hodgson remained away from the rehearsals, then\r\nreturning, developed by degrees a melancholy interest in the somewhat\r\ngloomy proceedings.\r\n\r\nSo far I had won, but my difficulty was to maintain the position. The\r\nlow comedian, reciting his lines with meaningless monotony, would pause\r\noccasionally to ask of me politely, whether this or that passage was\r\nintended to be serious or funny.\r\n\r\n“You think,” the leading lady would enquire, more in sorrow than in\r\nanger, “that any girl would behave in this way--any real girl, I mean?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the audience will understand it,” would console himself\r\nhopefully the tenor. “Myself, I confess I don't.”\r\n\r\nWith a sinking heart concealed beneath an aggressively disagreeable\r\nmanner, I remained firm in my “pigheaded conceit,” as it was regarded,\r\nHodgson generously supporting me against his own judgment.\r\n\r\n“It's bound to be a failure,” he told me. “I am spending some twelve to\r\nfifteen hundred pounds to teach you a lesson. When you have learnt it\r\nwe'll square accounts by your writing me an opera that will pay.”\r\n\r\n“And if it does succeed?” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“My dear boy,” replied Hodgson, “I never make mistakes.”\r\n\r\nFrom all which a dramatic author of more experience would have gathered\r\ncheerfulness and hope, knowing that the time to be depressed is when the\r\nmanager and company unanimously and unhesitatingly predict a six months'\r\nrun. But new to the business, I regarded my literary career as already\r\nat an end. Belief in oneself is merely the match with which one lights\r\noneself. The oil is supplied by the belief in one of others; if that\r\nbe not forthcoming, one goes out. Later on I might try to light myself\r\nagain, but for the present I felt myself dark and dismal. My desire was\r\nto get away from my own smoke and smell. The final dress rehearsal\r\nover, I took my leave of all concerned. The next morning I would pack\r\na knapsack and start upon a walking tour through Holland. The English\r\npapers would not reach me. No human being should know my address. In a\r\nmonth or so I would return, the piece would have disappeared--would be\r\nforgotten. With courage, I might be able to forget it myself.\r\n\r\n“I shall run it for three weeks,” said Hodgson, “then we'll withdraw it\r\nquietly, 'owing to previous arrangements'; or Duncan can suddenly fall\r\nill--she's done it often enough to suit herself; she can do it this\r\nonce to suit me. Don't be upset. There's nothing to be ashamed of in the\r\npiece; indeed, there is a good deal that will be praised. The idea is\r\ndistinctly original. As a matter of fact, that's the fault with it,”\r\n added Hodgson, “it's too original.”\r\n\r\n“You said you wanted it original,” I reminded him.\r\n\r\nHe laughed. “Yes, but original for the stage, I meant--the old dolls in\r\nnew frocks.”\r\n\r\nI thanked him for all his kindness, and went home and packed my\r\nknapsack.\r\n\r\nFor two months I wandered, avoiding beaten tracks, my only comrades a\r\nfew books, belonging to no age, no country. My worries fell from me, the\r\npersonal affairs of Paul Kelver ceasing to appear the be all and the\r\nend all of the universe. But for a chance meeting with Wellbourne,\r\nDeleglise's amateur caretaker of Gower Street fame, I should have\r\ndelayed yet longer my return. It was in one of the dead cities of the\r\nZuyder Zee. I was sitting under the lindens on the grass-grown quay,\r\nawaiting a slow, crawling boat that, four miles off, I watched a moving\r\nspeck across the level pastures. I heard his footsteps in the empty\r\nmarket-place behind me, and turned my head. I did not rise, felt even no\r\nastonishment; anything might come to pass in that still land of dreams.\r\nHe seated himself beside me with a nod, and for awhile we smoked in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“All well with you?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid not,” he answered; “the poor fellow is in great trouble.”\r\n\r\n“I'm not Wellbourne himself,” he went on, in answer to my look; “I am\r\nonly his spirit. Have you ever tested that belief the Hindoos hold:\r\nthat a man may leave his body, wander at will for a certain period,\r\nremembering only to return ere the thread connecting him with flesh and\r\nblood be stretched to breaking point? It is quite correct. I often lock\r\nthe door of my lodging, leave myself behind, wander a free Spirit.”\r\n\r\nHe pulled from his pocket a handful of loose coins and looked at them.\r\n“The thread that connects us, I am sorrow to say, is wearing somewhat\r\nthin,” he sighed; “I shall have to be getting back to him before\r\nlong--concern myself again with his troubles, follies. It is somewhat\r\nvexing. Life is really beautiful, when one is dead.”\r\n\r\n“What was the trouble?” I enquired.\r\n\r\n“Haven't you heard?” he replied. “Tom died five weeks ago, quite\r\nsuddenly, of syncope. We had none of us any idea.”\r\n\r\nSo Norah was alone in the world. I rose to my feet. The slowly moving\r\nspeck had grown into a thin, dark streak; minute by minute it took shape\r\nand form.\r\n\r\n“By the way, I have to congratulate you,” said Wellbourne. “Your opera\r\nlooked like being a big thing when I left London. You", " he replied. “Tom died five weeks ago, quite\r\nsuddenly, of syncope. We had none of us any idea.”\r\n\r\nSo Norah was alone in the world. I rose to my feet. The slowly moving\r\nspeck had grown into a thin, dark streak; minute by minute it took shape\r\nand form.\r\n\r\n“By the way, I have to congratulate you,” said Wellbourne. “Your opera\r\nlooked like being a big thing when I left London. You didn't sell\r\noutright, I hope?”\r\n\r\n“No,” I answered. “Hodgson never expressed any desire to buy.”\r\n\r\n“Lucky for you,” said Wellbourne.\r\n\r\nI reached London the next evening. Passing the theatre on my way to\r\nQueen's Square, it occurred to me to stop my cab for a few minutes and\r\nlook in.\r\n\r\nI met the low comedian on his way to his dressing-room. He shook me\r\nwarmly by the hand.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, “we're pulling them in. I was right, you see, 'Give me\r\nplenty of opportunity.' That's what I told you, didn't I? Come and see\r\nthe piece. I think you will agree with me that I have done you justice.”\r\n\r\nI thanked him.\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” he returned; “it's a pleasure to work, when you've got\r\nsomething good to work on.”\r\n\r\nI paid my respects to the leading lady.\r\n\r\n“I am so grateful to you,” said the leading lady. “It is so delightful\r\nto play a real live woman, for a change.”\r\n\r\nThe tenor was quite fatherly.\r\n\r\n“It is what I have been telling Hodgson for years,” he said, “give them\r\na simple human story.”\r\n\r\nCrossing the stage, I ran against Marmaduke Trevor.\r\n\r\n“You will stay for my scene,” he urged.\r\n\r\n“Another night,” I answered. “I have only just returned.”\r\n\r\nHe sank his voice to a whisper. “I want to talk to you on business, when\r\nyou have the time. I am thinking of taking a theatre myself--not just\r\nnow, but later on. Of course, I don't want it to get about.”\r\n\r\nI assured him of my secrecy.\r\n\r\n“If it comes off, I want you to write for me. You understand the public.\r\nWe will talk it over.”\r\n\r\nHe passed onward with stealthy tread.\r\n\r\nI found Hodgson in the front of the house.\r\n\r\n“Two stalls not sold and six seats in the upper circle,” he informed me;\r\n“not bad for a Thursday night.”\r\n\r\nI expressed my gratification.\r\n\r\n“I knew you could do it,” said Hodgson, “I felt sure of it merely from\r\nseeing that comedietta of yours at the Queen's. I never make a mistake.”\r\n\r\nCorrection under the circumstances would have been unkind. Promising to\r\nsee him again in the morning, I left him with his customary good conceit\r\nof himself unimpaired, and went on to the Square. I rang twice, but\r\nthere was no response. I was about to sound a third and final summons,\r\nwhen Norah joined me on the step. She had been out shopping and was\r\nladen with parcels.\r\n\r\n“We must wait to shake hands,” she laughed, as she opened the door. “I\r\nhope you have not been kept long. Poor Annette grows deafer every day.”\r\n\r\n“Have you nobody in the house with you but Annette?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No one. You know it was a whim of his. I used to get quite cross with\r\nhim at times. But I should not like to go against his wishes--now.”\r\n\r\n“Was there any reason for it?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No,” she answered; “if there had been I could have argued him out of\r\nit.” She paused at the door of the studio. “I'll just get rid of these,”\r\n she said, “and then I will be with you.”\r\n\r\nA wood fire was burning on the open hearth, flashing alternate beams of\r\nlight and shadow down the long bare room. The high oak stool stood\r\nin its usual place beside the engraving desk, upon which lay old\r\nDeleglise's last unfinished plate, emitting a dull red glow. I paced the\r\ncreaking boards with halting steps, as through some ghostly gallery\r\nhung with dim portraits of the dead and living. In a little while Norah\r\nentered and came to me with outstretched hand.\r\n\r\n“We will not light the lamp,” she said, “the firelight is so pleasant.”\r\n\r\n“But I want to see you,” I replied.\r\n\r\nShe had seated herself upon the broad stone kerb. With her hand she\r\nstirred the logs; they shot into a clear white flame. Thus, the light\r\nupon her face, she raised it gravely towards mine. It spoke to me with\r\nfuller voice. The clear grey eyes were frank and steadfast as ever, but\r\nshadow had passed into them, deepening them, illuminating them.\r\n\r\nFor a space we talked of our two selves, our trivial plans and doings.\r\n\r\n“Tom left something to you,” said Norah, rising, “not in his will, that\r\nwas only a few lines. He told me to give it to you, with his love.”\r\n\r\nShe brought it to me. It was the picture he had always treasured, his\r\nfirst success; a child looking on death; “The Riddle” he had named it.\r\n\r\nWe spoke of him, of his work, which since had come to be appraised at\r\ntruer value, for it was out of fashion while he lived.\r\n\r\n“Was he a disappointed man, do you think?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Norah. “I am sure not. He was too fond of his work.”\r\n\r\n“But he dreamt of becoming a second Millet. He confessed it to me once.\r\nAnd he died an engraver.”\r\n\r\n“But they were good engravings,” smiled Norah.\r\n\r\n“I remember a favourite saying of his,” continued Norah, after a pause;\r\n“I do not know whether it was original or not. 'The stars guide us. They\r\nare not our goal.'”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, we aim at the moon and--hit the currant bush.”\r\n\r\n“It is necessary always to allow for deflection,” laughed Norah.\r\n“Apparently it takes a would-be poet to write a successful comic opera.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you do not understand!” I cried. “It was not mere ambition; cap\r\nand bells or laurel wreath! that is small matter. I wanted to help. The\r\nworld's cry of pain, I used to hear it as a boy. I hear it yet. I meant\r\nto help. They that are heavy laden. I hear their cry. They cry from dawn\r\nto dawn and none heed them: we pass upon the other side. Man and woman,\r\nchild and beast. I hear their dumb cry in the night. The child's sob\r\nin the silence, the man's fierce curse of wrong. The dog beneath the\r\nvivisector's knife, the overdriven brute, the creature tortured for an\r\nhour that a gourmet may enjoy an instant's pleasure; they cried to me.\r\nThe wrong and the sorrow and the pain, the long, low, endless moan God's\r\nears are weary of; I hear it day and night. I thought to help.”\r\n\r\nI had risen. She took my face between her quiet, cool hands.\r\n\r\n“What do we know? We see but a corner of the scheme. This fortress\r\nof laughter that a few of you have been set apart to guard--this\r\nrallying-point for all the forces of joy and gladness! how do you know\r\nit may not be the key to the whole battle! It is far removed from the\r\ngrand charges and you think yourself forgotten. Trust your leader, be\r\ntrue to your post.”\r\n\r\nI looked into her sweet grey eyes.\r\n\r\n“You always help me,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Do I?” she answered. “I am so glad.”\r\n\r\nShe put her firm white hand in mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Paul Kelver, by Jerome Klapka, AKA Jerome K.\r\nJerome\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 1334 ***\r\n", "lapka, AKA Jerome K.\r\nJerome\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 1334 ***\r\n"]
